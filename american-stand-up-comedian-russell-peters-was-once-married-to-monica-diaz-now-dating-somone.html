He tours all around the world to perform in various fully-booked arenas with the crowd ready to gush out in laughter.&nbsp;</p><p>Peter is one of those people who spread laughter and happiness among human beings but is his personal life providing him with enough happiness? Is he dating anyone after divorce with Wife? Let's find out!&nbsp;</p><h2>Is Russell Peters in Relationship or still Single?</h2><p>Russell Peters is in a live-in together relationship with Jennifer Andrade, a former Miss Universe Honduras since November 2018. They started seeing each other from September 2018. Russell proposed his lady love with a bunch of rose and some gifts on October 11, 2018.</p><p>Together, the duo shares a son Russell Santiago. The stand-up comedian and his glamour model partner flaunt amazing chemistry together. Peters' sweetheart, Andrade's socials are showered with the pictures of her beau and their ten-month-old baby boy. The lovebirds welcomed their first child on 18 April 2019 in Cedars-Sinai.</p><p>Further, Jennifer showed off her third-trimester baby bump via Instagram six days prior to the birth. The starlet realized she's pregnant while watching an episode of the CBS show "Mom". Later then, she rushed to the drug store and bought four tests to assure herself. Jennifer enjoyed a magical baby shower on the 9th of April inviting some of her close friends.</p><h2>Russell Peters Engaged to Ruzanna Khetchian</h2><p>Russell was previously engaged to his fiance <strong>Ruzanna Khetchian</strong>. The couple got engaged in October 2016 and this time Russell maintained&nbsp;that he is taking it slow.</p><p>He was heard saying marriage will come when it is the right time for it and adding a little touch of his authentic sense of humor he added that there is still a lot of woman in this world.</p><img id=postimg src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/img.marriedwiki.com/uploads/2018/12/26/russell-peters-1545805057.jpg width=360 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p><strong><span class=imageCaption>Russell Peters and his fiancee Ruzanna</span></strong></p><p><strong><span class=imageSource>SOURCE: Global News</span></strong></p><p>Russell also told the media that he proposed her naked and on both knees, because he has a bad knee, so it would hurt him if he did it the traditional way. He held out a 4.25-carat diamond ring that has four lobster claws holding the stone, designed by <strong>Mark Lash Ruzanna</strong>.</p><p>Ketchikan sure couldn't resist the romantic gesture so she replied positively to the proposal.
