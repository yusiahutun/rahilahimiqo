We live so close, it’s embarrassing that we hadn’t eaten there yet, but the thing with the proximity is that every time we’ve popped our heads in, taken note of the mob of people crushed against the entryway and the “at least an hour and a half” wait, we’ve rationalized that we’ll go another time — later. Well, six months had passed since our last “later,” when on Saturday, so we decided arriving at the criminally early hour of 6 p.m. would outsmart the crowds. The laugh was still on us but the 45 minutes were well worth the wait, the tight space not claustrophobic but cozy on a freezing night as we snugged into a row of coats while drinking our first then second (mon dieu!) glass of their delicious sangria. At the bar, we couldn’t resist trying one of almost everything — marcona almonds, potatoes with aioli and hot paprika, ham-wrapped artichoke hearts with manchego cheese, deep-fried spicy chickpeas and thick, fork-tender white asparagus stalks again with that blessed aioli.</p><p><span id=more-193></span></p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/live.staticflickr.com/65535/52810192266_4321cffabc_z.jpg width=640 height=427 alt="mom's chocolate chip meringues-1" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><br><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/live.staticflickr.com/65535/52810598425_e57d976cc0_z.jpg width=640 height=427 alt="mom's chocolate chip meringues-2" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>By last night, it had been a whole two days since our last dose of aioli and we needed a fix. Alex grabbed some white asparagus, red potatoes and salad greens on his way home and I began mincing garlic for the sauce. Oh, how <i>easy</i> dinner will be, I thought… And now you see where this is going. The first aioli started out splendidly, but at some point near the end, when you start drizzling the olive oil more confidently, it split and if there’s one thing that’s impossible to fix, it’s a broken mayonnaise. Frustrated as hell, I didn’t want to associate mayonnaise-making with failure and unhappiness, and forced myself to make another, this time in the food processor. I’ve seen Emeril make his in there often (say whatever you want about the man; he always makes his mayo from scratch), and hey, isn’t that what the little drip-spout is for? This batch not only didn’t break, it didn’t come together at all. Four egg yolks, two CUPS of good olive oil, twelve cloves of garlic and any remaining joy I’d had toward cooking that night went right in the trash. I was ready to write the evening off completely — never happened, nobody needs to know, let’s not dwell on these failures, okay? — but I still had those four egg whites and I got clingy, unable to part with another ingredient.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/live.staticflickr.com/65535/52810645008_9d18c157c4_z.jpg width=640 height=427 alt="mom's chocolate chip meringues-6" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Growing up, we only did one thing and one thing only with leftover egg whites: we made mom’s chocolate chip meringue cookies. They’re absurdly easy to make, have a wonderfully high chip-to-cookie ratio and so few ingredients, you can count them on one hand and one toe. They look deceivingly plush; it’s only when you reach for them that you realize that they’re lighter than air and if you gently tap your nail against their exterior, it sounds like a ping-pong ball. They taste like marshmallows when just out of the oven but the next day, they actually dissolve in your mouth, leaving you with little bits of nuts and chocolate chips to ponder. Really, I dare you not to love them, to make them once and not immediately tuck them into your permanent repertoire, or to ever be able to throw away an unused egg white again.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/live.staticflickr.com/65535/52810645083_794bfab414_z.jpg width=640 height=427 alt="mom's chocolate chip meringues-7" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p><strong>Note: </strong>This recipe got fresh photos in 2023 and nobody, not a single person, will miss the old ones.</p><h3 class="p-name jetpack-recipe-title fn" itemprop=name>Mom's Chocolate Chip Meringue Cookies</h3><ul class=jetpack-recipe-meta><li class="jetpack-recipe-servings p-yield yield" itemprop=recipeYield><strong>Servings: </strong>15 to 20 cookies</li><li class=jetpack-recipe-time><strong>Time:</strong> <span class=time>45 minutes</span></li><li class=jetpack-recipe-source><strong>Source: </strong>Smitten Kitchen's Mom</li><li class=jetpack-recipe-print><a href=#>Print</a></li></ul><ul><li class="jetpack-recipe-ingredient p-ingredient ingredient" itemprop=recipeIngredient>2 egg whites, room temperature</li><li class="jetpack-recipe-ingredient p-ingredient ingredient" itemprop=recipeIngredient>1/4 teaspoon kosher salt</li><li class="jetpack-recipe-ingredient p-ingredient ingredient" itemprop=recipeIngredient>1/8 teaspoon cream of tartar</li><li class="jetpack-recipe-ingredient p-ingredient ingredient" itemprop=recipeIngredient>1 teaspoon vanilla</li><li class="jetpack-recipe-ingredient p-ingredient ingredient" itemprop=recipeIngredient>2/3 to 3/4 cup regular or superfine sugar (I use a bit less — a slightly heaped 1/2 cup)</li><li class="jetpack-recipe-ingredient p-ingredient ingredient" itemprop=recipeIngredient>6 ounces chocolate chips, miniature chips or finely diced semi or bittersweet chocolate</li><li class="jetpack-recipe-ingredient p-ingredient ingredient" itemprop=recipeIngredient>1/4 cup finely chopped pecans or walnuts, toasted first is even tastier (optional)</li></ul>Heat oven to 300°F.<p>Beat egg whites until thickened and foamy. Add salt, cream of tartar and vanilla, and beat mixture again until it holds soft peaks. Add the sugar, pouring very gradually, beating the batter until it is stiff. Gently fold in the chocolate and nuts, if using. Spoon batter onto parchment paper-lined baking sheets in 1 1/2 to 2-tablespoon mounds. Bake for 25 minutes. The cookies should have barely any color but the undersides (lift one) should be golden or lightly tanned. Let cool at room temperature.</p><p><b>Note:</b> There are two approaches to baking meringues. This shorter cooking time at a higher temperature yields a cookie with a crackly, crumbly exterior and an almost hollow center. <a href=#>A more traditional approach</a> is a longer baking time, 200 degrees for 1.5 to 2 hours. Take the longer-baked version out when they are slightly golden and firm to the touch. They will be more soft and fluffy, like miniature pavlovas.</p><h3 class=sd-title>Share this:</h3><ul><li class=share-twitter><a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-shared=sharing-twitter-193 class="share-twitter sd-button share-icon" href=# title="Click to share on Twitter"><span>Twitter</span></a></li><li class=share-facebook><a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-shared=sharing-facebook-193 class="share-facebook sd-button share-icon" href=# title="Click to share on Facebook"><span>Facebook</span></a></li><li class=share-email><a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-shared class="share-email sd-button share-icon" href=# title="Click to email a link to a friend" data-email-share-error-title="Do you have email set up?" data-email-share-error-text="If you're having problems sharing via email, you might not have email set up for your browser.
