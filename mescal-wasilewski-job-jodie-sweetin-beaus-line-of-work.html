He has had broad experience with numerous addictive behaviors, as well as comprehensive training in various therapeutic modalities. Also, he is EMDR trained and also well versed in 12 Step and harm-reduction modalities.</p><p>Additionally, with all of his compassion, Mescal adds, “If you need a compassionate and patient guide through whatever difficulties you may be facing, I can help.
