Thus, she did not have a job at that time. But even after her death, <a href=#>several authors</a> capitalised on her story to write a book. For example, William D.

However, the <a href=#>family</a> has continued petitioning the NYS Corrections Department to deny him parole, something they have done every two years since 2009.</p><h2>What happened to Katy Hawelka?</h2><p class=align-left>Katy Hawelka returned from town to her dormitory at Clarkson University on 29 August 1986. She had spent time with her friends, who were celebrating the beginning of the new school year at a local bar near the college campus. She took a shortcut behind the university's indoor hockey stadium, the Walker Arena.</p><p class=align-left>Twenty-five minutes later, a temporary security guard hired to oversee the arena's front office<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"> heard a noise </a>that sounded like someone hitting a door. The security guard called one of his colleagues to go and check it out. They drove behind the building and saw two people. But the two security guards could not approach the two individuals because they thought they were a couple engaging in s*ex.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/a54ec789bf389803.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Who was Carl Judie and what happened to him?

The security guards never thought too much about the couple because he worked at Clarkson University for two years, and it was not unusual for students to engage in se*x in suspicious places. So, the two men left the couple on the ground.</p><p class=align-left>It seemed like the couple never left the area. Thus, the guards decided to go back and check whether they were still around and call the police to have them removed. But when they returned, they found Katy Hawelka alone on the ground. She was unconscious and could not speak.</p><p class=align-left>Katy was ra*ped and beaten beyond recognition. The authorities took her to the hospital. But Katy Hawelka's injuries made it challenging for her family to identify her. Unfortunately, she died three days later. Her doctors declared her brain dead, forcing her parents to take her off life support.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/7ad36ddcda91fdb6.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>All about Dianne Holechek, actor Chuck Norris' first wife</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The police arrived at the scene and commenced their investigations. They found Brian Milton McCarthy, a 23-year-old Potsdam resident, hiding under a flight of stairs. After pulling him out, he complained of a back injury and claimed he witnessed the attack on Katy.</p><p class=align-left>The police later took a statement from him, which kept changing. Finally, they arrested and charged him with Katy Hawelka's murder. Brian entered a guilty plea to second-degree murder and was sentenced to 23 years to life in prison. As of 2022, Brian McCarthy continues to serve his time in prison for the murder of Katy.</p><h2>Katy Hawelka's fast facts</h2><li>Was Brian McCarthy Katy's boyfriend?
