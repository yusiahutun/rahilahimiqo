In a sport where many players feel that their career could be at risk if they came out, it takes a lot of courage to authentically live their truth. In fact, it wasn't until 2021 that an active player actually opened up about his sexuality. But thanks to the bravery of all the players who have decided to share their story so far, there's hope that the NFL will be a more inclusive place going forward.</p><p>Find out which football stars have come out as gay…</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:82b21e2a-49d4-4584-8f9c-38c11c62026c data-container-ref=toofab:article:4ba2b833-86de-4d4a-b3a2-1936cb9c0bae data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/38/5by4/2022/12/02/38cce70835cb49c59e4cf560c0db9457_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">11 Celebs Who Dated Bachelor Nation Stars</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p><strong>1. Carl Nassib</strong></p><p>Carl Nassib, who currently plays for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, is the first active NFL player to come out as gay. In an <a href=#>Instagram video</a> shared in June 2021, Carl opened up about his sexuality and expressed his gratitude for the support he'd been given so far from his teammates and coaches.</p><p>"I just wanted to take a quick moment to say that I'm gay," he said. "I've been meaning to do this for a while now but finally feel comfortable getting it off my chest. I really have the best life, the best family, friends and job a guy can ask for…I do not know all the history behind our courageous LGBTQ community, but I am eager to learn and to help continue the fight for equality and acceptance."</p><p><strong>2. Dave Kopay</strong></p><p>Former football player Dave Kopay was the first major professional athlete to come out in any sport. He shared his truth in a 1975 interview, several years after he retired from football. While he went on to release a best-selling autobiography, he was widely ostracized from the world of football for decades and had trouble getting a coaching job. Despite the difficulty, Dave says coming out was well received by his fans.</p><p>"I got very, very few hate mails," he told <a href=#>Outsports</a>. "Mostly the mail that poured in was amazingly supportive and telling their own stories. There were hundreds of letters forwarded to me."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:6627c294-7394-452e-8b61-de62159b291d data-container-ref=toofab:article:4ba2b833-86de-4d4a-b3a2-1936cb9c0bae data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/b6/5by4/2022/12/20/b6ff58962ea94771bca99168a855a977_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">13 Celebrity Memoirs From This Year You Need To Read</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p><strong>3. </strong><a href=#><strong>Michael Sam</strong></a></p><p>Michael Sam was still in college playing for the Missouri Tigers when he came out as gay. In 2014, he went on to become the first out player ever drafted by a professional team when he was recruited by the St. Louis Rams. Although he was cut before getting an official place on the roster, he did end up playing for the<a href=#> Montreal Alouettes</a>, making him the first openly gay player in the history of the Canadian Football League.</p><p><strong>4. </strong><a href=#><strong>Colton Underwood</strong></a></p><p>Colton Underwood played for several football teams including the San Diego Chargers and the Oakland Raiders before retiring from the sport in 2016. He went on to rise to fame on "The Bachelor" and although he left the show in a relationship with Cassie Randolph, they ended up splitting several years later. In 2021, Colton came out as gay, later sharing that he had been blackmailed into opening up about his sexuality. Despite the circumstance, Colton said he was in the best place he'd been in a long time.</p><p>"I'm emotional in such a good, happy, positive way. I'm the happiest and healthiest I've ever been in my life and that means the world to me," he <a href=#>shared</a>. "I got to a place in my personal life that was dark and bad and I can list a bunch of different things, but they'd all be excuses. I think overall the reason why now is because I got to a place where I didn't think I was ever going to share this."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:3e455d04-a691-404b-b3c4-aceb1a401417 data-container-ref=toofab:article:4ba2b833-86de-4d4a-b3a2-1936cb9c0bae data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/67/5by4/2022/11/04/673e401cf8cb431781b0506a784db3b9_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">13 Celebrities That Are Super Active And Real On TikTok</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p><strong>5. Ryan O'Callaghan</strong></p><p>In 2006, Ryan O'Callaghan was drafted by the New England Patriots. He went on to play professionally for 5 years, including time with the Kansas City Chiefs. It wasn't until 2017 that he decided to come out, admitting that at times in his life, he would have rather not been alive than reveal his sexuality. He finally made the decision to come out after dealing with painkiller abuse and seeking counseling.</p><p>"Being gay wasn't just a small detail in my life, it consumed it. It's all I would think about. But now that I have come out it rarely crosses my mind. Yeah I'd go about my daily life in football, but thinking about hiding it and hoping no one finds out and being ready for any situation was exhausting," Ryan told <a href=#>Outsports</a>.</p><p><strong>6. Kwame Harris</strong></p><p>Kwame Harris played in the NFL for five seasons with the San Francisco 49ers and the Oakland Raiders before retiring after the 2008 season. While he hadn't planned on opening up about his sexuality, he was outed after a domestic dispute with his then-boyfriend landed him in jail in 2013. He then decided to officially come out and looking back says he wishes he had the courage to do it sooner.</p><p>"I didn't see those two things [coming out and playing in the NFL] as being compatible, but now when I look back in hindsight, if I could have done it differently, I'd like to think that I would find the strength, or find the fortitude or the grace to make the hard decision," he told <a href=#>CNN</a>.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:309b6ba0-e48f-46b1-b9a0-a3b28aed0f88 data-container-ref=toofab:article:4ba2b833-86de-4d4a-b3a2-1936cb9c0bae data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/19/5by4/2021/04/14/19887a0002e440cf94a797c4b15c912c_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Colton Underwood Discusses Bachelor 'Regret' After Coming Out</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p><strong>7.

After stepping away from the sport in 2018, Ryan came out as bisexual in a touching essay for ESPN. Since then, Ryan has worked to help the NFL become more inclusive of the LGBTQ+ community.</p><p>"I am proud to be an out bisexual Black man, and it's time the NFL was proud to have me and others like me as an active part of their family," he wrote in an essay for <a href=#>Out</a>. "Football is for everyone and since I came out in August of 2019, I have dedicated myself to ensuring that is the case."</p><p><strong>8. Roy Simmons</strong></p><p>From 1979 to 1983, Roy Simmons played as an offensive lineman with the Giants and the Redskins, now known as the Washington Commanders.

He went on to publish a memoir, "Out of Bounds: Coming Out of Sexual Abuse, Addiction and My Life of Lies in the NFL," in 2006.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:0d13de6b-0dc1-4c50-8a8f-474b476112c0 data-container-ref=toofab:article:4ba2b833-86de-4d4a-b3a2-1936cb9c0bae data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/21/5by4/2022/06/03/21c0afdbb17d4db8b81a7efcffe41f23_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">11 Heartwarming Celebrity Coming Out Stories</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p><strong>9.

That year, Jeff, who was previously married to a woman, tied the knot with his boyfriend Joshua Ross. The nuptials made him the first NFL player ever in a same-sex marriage.</p><p>"If I had told the Dallas Cowboys in the 1980s that I was gay, I would have been cut immediately. It was a different world back then, people didn’t want to hear that," he told the <a href=#>New York Times</a>, later adding, "When I got divorced, I said the hell with it, I'm going to do what I've always wanted to do. Then I found Josh, and began to openly live the life I was born to live."</p><p>1<strong>0.

He says he credits Dave Kopay with changing his life, explaining that after reading his book he no longer felt alone.</p><p>"My mom saved my life, but David Kopay changed my life. I read the whole book and I just broke down crying because I saw myself," Esera said on "<a href=#>Good Morning America</a>."</p><a id=gallery-link-674b9286-983b-42e3-8b5f-fea2e1b93e80 class="media-link gallery-block__link js-track-link js-click-gallery" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:gallery:674b9286-983b-42e3-8b5f-fea2e1b93e80 data-context='{"name":"gallery-block","section":"permalink"}' data-container-ref=toofab:article:4ba2b833-86de-4d4a-b3a2-1936cb9c0bae data-gallery-layout=carousel><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/c5/4by3/2023/01/30/c530ee7aad694f71a08a885a7958a2f8_md.jpg width=825 height=618 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3R7j2tmaW1fZn1uusWlZKyskafAbsPHqK2eZZOkuqZ5zq6rZpmjYrSixY4%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./20-surprising-facts-about-spirea.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>20 Surprising Facts About Spirea</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./amanda-peet-cabbage-breastfeeding-ellen-degeneres-show-video.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Why Does Amanda Peet Have Cabbage on Her Boobs?!</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./409878-100-summer-instagram-captions-sunny-funny-html.html>100+ summer Instagram captions that are sunny and funny</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-neck-cream.html>19 Best Neck Creams of 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./angelina-jolie-daughter-vivienne-resembles-brad-pitt-new-photo.html>Angelina Jolie's daughter Vivienne looks just like Brad Pitt in new photo from momentous outing toge</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chicagos-summer-smash-festival-signs-a-ticketing-deal-with-dice.html>Chicagos Summer Smash Festival Signs A Ticketing Deal With DICE</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./fosters-voice-reaching-his-peers-with-organization-of-school-club.html>Foster's Voice reaching his peers with organization of school club</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog.
