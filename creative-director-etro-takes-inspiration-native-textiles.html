I have always loved textiles, and I always plan my travels around places where I will find culture and beautiful textiles. I also love archaeology, but a career in archaeology doesn't pay.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">I have been to India, Myanmar, and many other places where I know I can be inspired. I have done the Silk Road three or four times. I collect textiles and usually return with fabrics which may be a starting point for a collection.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The current season was inspired by the silk route. It is a bit Tartar looking, mixing rich, gold fabrics with heavy tweeds and wools in that northern oriental way.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The textiles are an inspiration to me. We change the colours, and maybe play with the patterns on the computer, and the textures, to customise them.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The thinking for the new summer collection meanwhile is Navajo; a Native American Indian influence, but more luxurious.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">It has a bohemian, 1970s feel, but that is very Etro. We've been doing that for a long time, although it may be a little softer for summer.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">I bought some beautiful Tibetan and 1930s-style Chinese carpets in Hollywood Road, which I keep at home.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">I have travelled through Yunnan province, where you can find a lot of minority tribes living near each other, wearing an array of beautiful embroideries and striped fabrics.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">I like to see the people that still wear a certain kind of clothes. The custom is disappearing, and in 50 years' time we won't see those people wearing traditional clothes.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">I joined the family business, which was founded by my father Gerolamo "Gimmo" Etro in 1968, when I was very young. I was supposed to have been called up for military service, but 1962 (the year I was born) had a baby boom.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">So in 1981, I was waiting around to hear when I would be called to barracks, and had to find something to do. I loved textiles so much that I started working in the Etro textile warehouse and sample room, learning about silk and cotton.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">When I was told I wouldn't be needed for military service, I had a choice: go to university in London to study politics, philosophy and economics, or continue with what I was doing. I thought, why should I study something I am not interested in. So I stayed with Etro, which made my father very happy.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In 1981, we introduced a furnishing textiles line, as well as the paisley motif used to enrich the first collection. That has become part of our DNA. A few years later we did leather goods again, using the paisley jacquards.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Our latest project is an accessories collaboration with the Japanese photographer Mika Ninogawa, which will arrive in Hong Kong next spring.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">She has taken two of our paisley patterns and turned them into something wild and surreal with her signature saturated colour palette.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Our menswear, which [brother] Kean designs, was launched in the 1990s, but I am not a garment person so I was very glad when [sister] Veronica wanted to design a womenswear collection.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">We work together a lot and she is always coming up with ideas. We have a graphics team, as I have to do a lot more on the business side of the brand now, as we have no investors and are opening new stores.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">I also sit on the board of the Camera Nazionale della Moda (Italian Fashion Council). But textile research is what I love and what I do to relax. It may be work but it doesn't seem like it, because it is what I love doing."</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">As told to Francesca Fearon</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kuaqyxKyrsqSVZK6zwMico55nYWuEc4OPamacqpWWwarCxGaboqqVmMGwvoyeq6unXamurLHSZqCnq6Cev6LAyKilZqaRqba3sYytnLGsmaGytA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./fetty-wap-and-elaynna.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Fetty Wap and Elaynna - Dating, Gossip, News, Photos</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./9-chinese-new-year-taboos-avoid.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>9 Chinese New Year taboos to avoid - YP</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./409878-100-summer-instagram-captions-sunny-funny-html.html>100+ summer Instagram captions that are sunny and funny</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-neck-cream.html>19 Best Neck Creams of 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./angelina-jolie-daughter-vivienne-resembles-brad-pitt-new-photo.html>Angelina Jolie's daughter Vivienne looks just like Brad Pitt in new photo from momentous outing toge</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chicagos-summer-smash-festival-signs-a-ticketing-deal-with-dice.html>Chicagos Summer Smash Festival Signs A Ticketing Deal With DICE</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./fosters-voice-reaching-his-peers-with-organization-of-school-club.html>Foster's Voice reaching his peers with organization of school club</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog.
