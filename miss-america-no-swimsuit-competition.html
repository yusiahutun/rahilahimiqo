We are a competition. We will no longer judge our candidates on their outward physical appearance," Gretchen Carlson, former Miss America and chair of the organization's board of trustees, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/Culture/miss-america-scrapping-swimsuit-competition-longer-judge-based/story?id=55638426" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="broke the news" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">broke the news</a> on Good Morning America today.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The contest is also "revamping" the evening gown portion of the event, Carlson added. "We're no longer judging women when they come out in their chosen attire, their eveningwear. Whatever they choose to do, it's going to be what comes out of their mouth that we're interested in when they talk about their social impact initiatives," she said.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The changes are official starting with the next Miss America competition on September 9 in Atlantic City, NJ.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The organization also says it'll become more inclusive in terms of body diversity. When asked if the competition will now feature "women of all shapes and sizes," Carlson answered, "Yes, we want to be open, transparent, inclusive to women who may not have felt comfortable participating in our program before."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"We want more women to know that they are welcome in this organization," Carlson later added. She also emphasized the scholarships connected to the competition.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The pageant revamp fittingly arrives in the #MeToo movement, which Carlson visibly became a part of after <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://variety.com/2017/tv/features/gretchen-carlson-sexual-harassment-advocate-roger-ailes-fox-news-1202032265/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="filing a sexual harassment lawsuit" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">filing a sexual harassment lawsuit</a> against Fox News Chairman Roger Ailes, which led to his departure.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The changes also follow an <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/miss-america-ceo-emails_us_5a3bd266e4b025f99e153fdb data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="email scandal" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">email scandal</a> last December in which former Miss America officials denigrated the intelligence, appearance, and sex lives of former title winners. The controversy led to a shake-up at the top, and the group's top three leadership positions are now held by women.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Carlson also isn't worried that removing the swimsuits will affect ratings. "Interestingly enough, that's not a highly rated part of the competition," she said on GMA. "People actually really like the talent part of the competition."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Associated Press contributed reporting.</p><span class="css-1s9owpq ev8dhu51"><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/67055711-c808-4a4d-811a-e7155a2bce10_1667409691.file?fill=1:1&resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Erica Gonzales" title="Headshot of Erica Gonzales" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Erica Gonzales is the Senior Culture Editor at ELLE.com, where she oversees coverage on TV, movies, music, books, and more.
