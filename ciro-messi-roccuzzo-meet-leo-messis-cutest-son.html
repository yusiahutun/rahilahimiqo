As the youngest son, he was somewhat shielded from the public eye, and little is known about him. Here’s a peek into his life.</strong></p><p>Ciro is the last child of world-famous football star Lionel Messi and his wife Antonella, but little is known about him. Who is Ciro Messi Roccuzzo, and what is his story?&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_Is_Ciro_Messi_Roccuzzo></span>Who Is Ciro Messi Roccuzzo?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Ciro Messi Rocuzzo, born on March 10, 2018, is the last-born son of Antonella Roccuzzo and Lionel Messi. He is famously known for having the most striking resemblance to his father out of the three children.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Ciro-927x1024.jpg><p>Ciro’s father, Lionel Andrés Messi, is no stranger to football fans worldwide. Arguably one of the greatest footballers the world has ever seen, the Argentine professional footballer captains both Inter Miami FC and the Argentina national team, the most recent champions of the <a href=#>World Cup</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Ciro’s mother, Antonella Roccuzzo, is also an Argentine native who is now a body fitness enthusiast with multiple business interests.&nbsp;Ciro is currently enrolled in a private school, and his parents, being the private people that they are, share very little of his personal life on social media.</p><p>His mother, Antonella, usually posts him often along with pictures of her other two kids and on his birthdays.&nbsp;He is generally perceived as a sweet child, with people on social media always emphasizing how “cute” he is. Lionel has Ciro’s date of birth inscribed on his calf, while Antonella has his name, “Ciro,” tattooed on her arm.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=The_Crazy_Viral_Theory_About_Ciro_Messi_Roccuzzo></span>The Crazy Viral Theory About Ciro Messi Roccuzzo<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>A couple of years ago, a theory about Ciro not existing in real life went viral on Twitter. This was because his parents did not post his pictures as often as his other brothers, and he did not attend a court hearing with them. Many began to speculate that Ciro was not real and that the Messi family had lied about his existence.&nbsp;</p><p>Understandably, this greatly angered the Messi family, and both parents took to social media to debunk the rumors. His mother explained that Ciro was not in those family photos because he was a tiny one-year-old baby who often fell asleep before any photo shoot. She also very expressed her displeasure at the rumors. Subsequently, Ciro began to appear more frequently in family photos that were shared online.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_Are_Ciro_Messi_Roccuzzos_Siblings></span>Who Are Ciro Messi Roccuzzo’s Siblings?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Ciro Messi is the last of three sons of the Messi family. He has two brothers, Thiago and Mateo.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Thiago-and-Mateo-819x1024.jpg><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Thiago></span>Thiago<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Born on November 2, 2012, Thiago is the family’s first-born son. He loves motorcycles and cars and is said to have started playing football just like his father at a young age. The young chap was a Barcelona Academy, La Masia member before his family moved to Paris following his father’s change of clubs. His name and handprints are tattooed on Lionel’s calf too!</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Mateo></span>Mateo<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Ciro’s second sibling is also a young boy named Mateo. Mateo was born on September 15, 2015. While Thiago is described as the “calm” older brother, Mateo is said to have taken after Lionel Messi’s competitiveness.&nbsp;</p><p>Lionel’s competitiveness is often said to be similar to that of his football idol and late Argentine star, <a href=#>Diego Maradona</a>. Lionel Messi mentioned that Mateo deeply feels every football match loss and sometimes leaves the stadium crying.&nbsp;</p><p>According to Lionel, he is the jokester of the group and never passes up an opportunity to tease his dad or brothers, like cheering for the opposing team. Mateo supported his dad through all of the 2022 World Cup games. He was excited when his dad won, as he was seen grabbing the Golden Ball trophy and ready to run off with it.&nbsp;</p><p>Mateo’s name can be seen tattooed on Lionel’s right sleeve.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=What_Sports_Do_Lionel_Messis_Kids_Play></span>What Sports Do Lionel Messi’s Kids Play?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Lionel Messi’s kids have been interested in soccer from a very young age, just like their dad. This could be because they grew up on the field and enjoy the game just as much. The kids and their mother are usually in the bleachers, cheering Lionel on during his matches.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/269925326_133948455736456_8664827589173329842_n-2.jpg><p>Thiago and Mateo enrolled in the Paris Saint Germain soccer academy during their father’s time as team forwards. Lionel often uploads videos of his boys playing football in their backyard with their family pet dog, “Senor Hulk,” a huge brown Dogue de Bordeaux.&nbsp;</p><p>Ciro is still developing his personality, and according to Lionel Messi in an interview in October 2022, he’s already taking after his immediate older brother. “He copies Mateo a lot, and they go against me a lot,” said the 7-time Ballon d’Or winner.</p><p>They appear to be a very happy family, and we can’t wait to see what else Lionel Messi’s kids get up to in the coming years!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifmajBp7HSrWWcp51ksKq%2Bzmaknqujnnqzu8KcrLOyn2K6prHTZqOep12isrS%2FyKxknK2kmsC1edKopWg%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./former-scandal-star-columbus-short-ordered-leave-marital-home-wife-granted-restraining-order-drunken-rages-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Former Scandal star Columbus Short 'ordered to leave marital home'</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./tiger-king-photos-zoom-backgrounds.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>'Tiger King' Zoom Backgrounds For Cool Cats &amp;amp; Kittens</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./409878-100-summer-instagram-captions-sunny-funny-html.html>100+ summer Instagram captions that are sunny and funny</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-neck-cream.html>19 Best Neck Creams of 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./angelina-jolie-daughter-vivienne-resembles-brad-pitt-new-photo.html>Angelina Jolie's daughter Vivienne looks just like Brad Pitt in new photo from momentous outing toge</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chicagos-summer-smash-festival-signs-a-ticketing-deal-with-dice.html>Chicagos Summer Smash Festival Signs A Ticketing Deal With DICE</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./fosters-voice-reaching-his-peers-with-organization-of-school-club.html>Foster's Voice reaching his peers with organization of school club</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog.
