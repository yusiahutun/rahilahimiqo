Feed’s case is one of more than 300 that are currently under review.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">How many lives have been affected is unknown, but at the height of South Korea’s adoption boom in the 1980s – when the country was still a dictatorship and the industry was being fuelled by social stigma at unexpected pregnancies and a lack of legal protection for mothers – nearly 9,000 children were being put up for overseas adoption in some years.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1">Given away hours after birth</h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">South Korean society is only now beginning to come to terms with the human impact of mass adoption policies on the country’s biological mothers and their babies.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Family law has been reformed and with it a household registration system often described as “patriarchal” for making it near-impossible for single mothers to register the birth of a child. Foreign adoptions also now require approval from the country’s family courts under a 2011 change to the law that came into effect a year later.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">But there were no such protections back in 1990, when Jeon Hyun-suk says she was pressured by her mother to give away her newborn son, who was conceived out of wedlock, soon after birth.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“The next morning he went straight to an adoption facility and I was sent to a home for unmarried mothers to rest,” Jeon, now age 54, told This Week in Asia.</p><figure data-qa=Component-StyledFigure class="css-1yuz473 exv1azg4">I tried to plead with my mum, begging her to let me keep the babyJeon Hyun-suk, birth mother of an oversea adoptee</figure><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“From the moment he was gone, I wanted to find him and bring him back … I tried to plead with my mum, begging her to let me keep the baby,” but all she got in reply was: “it would put you in a very difficult position, honey … you’re 21.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Jeon spent the next three decades living with profound regret, until at long last she was reunited with her son, now a US citizen, in 2021.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">A cascade of similar cases have come Seoul-based Pastor Kim Do-hyun’s way over the decades he’s worked with women whose children were adopted, as well as the adoptees themselves.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Korean “Confucian tradition” was the source of attitudes “oppressing women who are pregnant before marriage,” Kim said. In the past, single mothers who wished to raise a child out of wedlock would have been denied maternity services by adoption agencies, he said, often pushing them to give up their children anyway and resulting in what he called “truly a baby farm”.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto

class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">It’s now illegal for agencies to require a woman in South Korea to decide on adoption before maternity services are provided under the reforms passed in 2011, which also mandated that agency information be verified by family courts before approval is granted for adoption – a measure experts say has helped greatly curtail inaccuracies in adoptees’ paperwork.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">One such inaccuracy that had previously appeared time and again was the label “orphan” being attached to thousands of children who in reality had at least one surviving birth parent.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">This fed into a long-standing Western narrative that South Korea in the 1980s was a poverty stricken place where destitute mothers were forced to abandon their babies – as opposed to a booming economy enjoying rapid annual growth that at times exceeded 10 per cent, as it was in reality.</p><figure data-qa=Component-StyledFigure class="css-1yuz473 exv1azg4">‘Orphan’ is wonderful for Westerners … because [they say] this orphan has no parentsSouth Korean Pastor Kim Do-hyun</figure><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“‘Orphan’ is wonderful for Westerners,” Kim said. “Because [they say] this orphan has no parents, [so] ‘I’m responsible for taking care of the child in the world’ … but if you adopted a child whose mum is alive … ‘how do I raise a child who has a mum?’”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Instead of altruism, the pastor said he suspects some South Korean adoption agencies were motivated solely by financial gain.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Activists say South Korea’s own birth and family registration system was also to blame for children being falsely recorded as “orphans” with overseas adopters, while some were recorded as having been given away voluntarily by their biological parents when this was not the case.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Before a landmark 2005 Constitutional Court decision led to its abolition, the family register – often referred to as hojuk and based on the idea that all families must have a patriarch – made it all but impossible for unwed mothers to record births.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9

with a supportive environment in a safe hometown and had loving adoptive parents.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Still, she says she experienced instances of racism, depressive episodes and lived with a constant desire to find out the truth about her own history.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6

Norwegian state, of human trafficking.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Norwegian prosecutors have so far dismissed her case citing a lack of resources, Feed said, but she is appealing the decision.</p><figure data-qa=Component-StyledFigure class="css-1yuz473 exv1azg4">I can now prove that it’s been falsified, and that it’s not a valid

organisation said it was in favour of international regulations on transnational adoptions, promotes local adoption whenever feasible and supports the international Hague Adoption Convention.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">That convention, which entered into force in 1995, sets out best practice for transnational adoptions and requires
