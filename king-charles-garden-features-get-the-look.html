If you decide to add more greenery to your outdoor space for privacy, ensure you research beforehand to find a plant that will give you the coverage you need.

Mosses and lichens will add velvet and colour to your garden, and, in spring, there will be a pageant of wildflowers, such as primroses and bluebells. You can also grow climbers into the branches, such as ivy and honeysuckle, to give your space a woodland feel.
