Kacey Morgan, a 15-year veteran of the department, was selected by his fellow firefighters as the Officer of the Year. Firefighter Josh Hatten, a 10-year veteran of the department, was selected as Firefighter of the Year.</p><p>Morgan has been an officer for four years. He decided years ago that he was looking for a career in public service, something with a little more action than the normal 9-to-5 retail opportunities available. So he applied for both the police department and the fire department and it was the latter that grabbed him first. Since then, he has found both his career and a true brotherhood.</p><p>“It is awesome that my peers have recognized me,” Morgan said. “I have come to find out that this is my calling, and I am ready to keep giving it 300 percent!”</p><p>Hatten says he was looking for something better for himself than a typical dead-end job over a decade ago when he first applied to the department.</p><p>“I love my job, my brothers in the department, the camaraderie and, especially, the look of honor on my kids faces when they see their daddy,” he said.</p><p>LFD Chief Leo Brown reinstated the awards luncheon in 2021 after it had been dormant for several years. The annual awards ceremony is sponsored by State Farm agents Brian Ginn and Lori Hearn. With their help, the annual recognition has received new life to especially honor and recognize the hard work and bravery of the entire department.</p><p>Ginn said that State Farm is appreciative of the work the department does to protect their customers and other homeowners.</p><p>“And what is really nice about this is that the awards are peer-based, with each recipient being chosen from among their fellow firefighters,” he said.</p><p>Brown, who has been with the LFD since 1993, has watched both of the award winners progress and grow through the years. And these two especially are team players, always looking out for others, he said.</p><p>“A lot of times we only hear some people that bring to light the negatives,” Hearn said. “But to be a part of bringing out the positive and recognizing a group of people that don’t get nearly enough credit is an awesome thing to be a part of.”</p><p>Laurel Mayor Johnny Magee was on hand to congratulate the winners and to thank all of the firefighters on behalf of the city of Laurel.</p><p>Magee said he was proud of the department and its work over the past year.</p><p>“We have a great (fire) department, and they are truly like a family,” Magee said.</p><p>There are currently 35 firefighters and 13 officers who make up the department. The Laurel Fire Department will host a civil service exam for firefighter recruits on Dec. 16, and are looking to add to their growing ranks.</p><p>Anyone interested in joining the LFD should apply in person at the Laurel City Hall human resources office.
