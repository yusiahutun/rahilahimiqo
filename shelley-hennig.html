On August 16, 2008, she hosted the, Miss.

In 2010, she received her first nomination for the 37th Daytime Emmy Awards in the Outstanding Younger Actress in a Drama Series category and was again nominated in 2012. She left the show on January 18, 2011 after 4 years of playing Stephanie.</p><p>After she left the show, in 2011 she was casted in the lead role as Diana Meade in the TV series The Secret Circle. The series was based on the books written by L.J Smith. But the show was cancelled after only one season on 11th May, 2012. &nbsp;Shelley also appeared in the series Zach Stone Is Gonna Be Famous where she played the role of Christy, but sadly the show also got cancelled after one season on June 23, 2013.</p><p>Hennig was also on MTV’s hit series ‘Teen Wolf’ where she plays the character of Malia Tate.

Also in the same year it was rumored that she was dating Thomas Dekker.&nbsp;</p><p>She was also linked with Ben McKenzie in 2013 and with her teen wolf co-star Dylan O’Brien in 2014. But at that time O’Brien was already in a relation with Hennig’s friend and previous co-star Britt Robertson. The rumors was dismissed soon after claiming Shelley and Dylan are just good friends.</p><p>Currently there are no rumors about her dating anyone so it can be assumed that she is single .</p><h2>Net worth</h2><p>Shelley earns big bucks from her acting and modeling career and her estimated net worth is around $ 1 million and we are sure that it will increase in the near future.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmilkae%2FqrHDsKCkoV6YvK571qKiomejnbKtuMSyZKGdnqO2qA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./what-guys-think-about-your-hair.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>What Men Actually Think of Your Hair Color</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./robert-sandberg-bio-age-relationship-girlfriend-net-worth.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Robert Sandberg Bio, Age, Relationship, Girlfriend &amp;amp; Net Worth</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./409878-100-summer-instagram-captions-sunny-funny-html.html>100+ summer Instagram captions that are sunny and funny</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-neck-cream.html>19 Best Neck Creams of 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./angelina-jolie-daughter-vivienne-resembles-brad-pitt-new-photo.html>Angelina Jolie's daughter Vivienne looks just like Brad Pitt in new photo from momentous outing toge</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chicagos-summer-smash-festival-signs-a-ticketing-deal-with-dice.html>Chicagos Summer Smash Festival Signs A Ticketing Deal With DICE</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./fosters-voice-reaching-his-peers-with-organization-of-school-club.html>Foster's Voice reaching his peers with organization of school club</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog.
