I know it's fast but we are living life each day to its fullest. I choose happiness every morning and every night."</p><p>Insisting that she would be "tuning out all negative energy," Porsha nevertheless did offer some details as to how this came to be, saying that she was doing so "for all you people that need facts."</p><p>And because she "gets the optics," which could certainly be interpreted in a non-favorable way considering she and Falynn appear on the same show. Nevertheless, Porsha insists there was nothing untoward going on, and there never has been.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:bfbc5dfe-8eb7-4960-9468-a99c769e7b9e data-container-ref=toofab:article:1bc93049-7d23-4089-be1c-24da33252f09 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/80/5by4/2021/05/07/804619069d01437ebb98653cf78db73b_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Bravo</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Ex-Housewives Confront Andy Cohen On Things He Did or Said That 'Hurt' Them</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>Waiting for your permission to load the Instagram Media.</p><p>At first, she didn't even mention Falynn by name, instead writing, "Simon filed for divorce from a previous marriage in January. I had nothing to do with their divorce filing. That’s between the two of them."</p><p>It's the fact that Falynn and Simon went public only in late April that created the appearance of an overlapping timeline in the relationships. Porsha then went on to pointedly add, "Falynn and I are not friends, and Simon’s divorce has been settled." She went on to again emphasize that this is "a positive, living step forward in everyone's lives."</p><p>Then, as if responding directly to that Mother's Day photo that featured Porsha, Simon and her ex (and father to her two-year-old daughter) Dennis McKinley, Porsha quickly moved away from all talk of Falynn and instead focused on how the two men in her life are committed to "being the best co-parents they can be to baby PJ."</p><p>As many have pointed out, it's perhaps not as odd as it might seem that Porsha and Simon have gotten cozy. Simon and Dennis have worked together, so Porsha has known him longer than it might appear, and not just through his relationship to "RHOA" and Falynn.</p><p>One thing Porsha did not address, though, was the ring so prominently featured in that and other photos and videos on both her Instagram and Instagram Stories. Thankfully, Simon also shared the big news on his page, and he wasn't nearly as coy.</p><p>Waiting for your permission to load the Instagram Media.</p><p>Simon followed Porsha's post a few hours later with a statement of his own on Instagram, sharing a series of pics, including a prominent shot of that prominent ring! He thanked their supporters and well wishers, and then confirmed that they are indeed engaged.</p><p>"Getting married again was never a question in my mind, but when. [sic] Did not expect to be blessed with a mate so soon," he wrote. While that was largely unclear, but certainly seemed to suggest engagement, further reading clarified everything.</p><p>He went on to say that they've both done the work individually to be able to sustain a healthy marriage. "I asked her to marry me because we checked ALL of each other’s boxes, and then some," he wrote. "I stand next to her, proud that we found each other."</p><p>"What we have is what we wish every single one of you out there - happiness. So when I asked...she said yes," he said. "That is ALL that mattered."</p><p>Falynn has not posted since either of their respective announcements, while Porsha and Simon turned off commenting on both their posts. Before that happened, however, LaToya Ali wrote, "I love, love" on Porsha's post -- while Andy Cohen wrote "Mazel" and NeNe Leakes added "Congrats P! Always choose happiness first #Lovewins."</p><p>Kenya Moore, who has often been at odds with Porsha on "RHOA," appeared to react to the news with a shady video:</p><a id=gallery-link-f3128145-65d7-443f-a008-04321601cf3c class="media-link gallery-block__link js-track-link js-click-gallery" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:gallery:f3128145-65d7-443f-a008-04321601cf3c data-context='{"name":"gallery-block","section":"permalink"}' data-container-ref=toofab:article:1bc93049-7d23-4089-be1c-24da33252f09 data-gallery-layout=carousel><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/63/4by3/2021/05/10/63e016e9719548649a0ca21318c624fc_md.jpg width=825 height=618 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3J7j25mamlfpbyzv8eaZLChnKG2ornSZqWer12irq950aGmmmWTpHq0wMCrZJ%2BZnK67r3nGqKybmZSerm6x12afrquSlrulew%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./the-queen-favourite-tea-brand.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>The Queen's tea-drinking habits exposed: favourite brands and THAT pinky rumour</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./nba-player-enes-kanter-freedom-dating-carls-jr-burger-model-emily-sears-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>NBA player Enes Kanter Freedom is dating Carl's Jr. burger model Emily Sears</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./409878-100-summer-instagram-captions-sunny-funny-html.html>100+ summer Instagram captions that are sunny and funny</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-neck-cream.html>19 Best Neck Creams of 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./angelina-jolie-daughter-vivienne-resembles-brad-pitt-new-photo.html>Angelina Jolie's daughter Vivienne looks just like Brad Pitt in new photo from momentous outing toge</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chicagos-summer-smash-festival-signs-a-ticketing-deal-with-dice.html>Chicagos Summer Smash Festival Signs A Ticketing Deal With DICE</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./fosters-voice-reaching-his-peers-with-organization-of-school-club.html>Foster's Voice reaching his peers with organization of school club</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog.
