And he can fire everybody in the company from the chairman on down, simply by spending his money somewhere else.” </strong>-Sam Walton</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=1-early-life-and-career>1. Early life and career</h3><p>Walton began his professional journey in 1940 when he first stepped into the retail business. He worked as a sales trainee at a J.C. Penny store in Des Moines, Iowa. Right from the start, he hated to make customers wait, as he dwelled through the paperwork, messed up books, etc. But that didn’t stop Walton from outperforming, and Walton was an extremely talented salesman, adding about $25 per month in commissions to his salary.<br></p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=2-sam-walton-joined-the-united-states-army-and-funded-his-store>2. Sam Walton joined the United States Army, and funded his store!</h3><p><a href=# rel=noopener>Sam Walton</a> was drafted into the United States Army in 1942, where he served as a communications officer in the Army Intelligence Corps during World War II.

At age 27, he put $5,000 of his money, borrowed $20,000 from his father-in-law, and purchased a Ben Franklin store in Newport, Arkansas.<br></p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=3-sam-s-business-grew-the-good-news-didn-t-follow-but-a-new-store-did>3. Sam’s business grew, the good news didn’t follow, but a new store did!</h3><p>Sam always<strong> </strong>knew how to win a customer’s heart, and made a policy of pricing products well below other retailers, tripling his business. In 1950 he owned the leading Ben Franklin store in a six-state area, and this success attracted the landlord who refused to renew Sam’s lease, despite Sam’s opposition to it! This did not stop Sam, and he set up a shop in the tiny community of Bentonville, insisting on a 99-year lease. By 1960, he proudly owned 15 stores.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=4-walton-s-search-for-profits-and-the-inception-of-walmart>4. Walton’s search for profits, and the inception of Walmart</h3><p>Walton’s business grew, but he did not get the profits he was expecting. He decided to take a new strategy – dramatically cut prices, and make it up with a high volume of sales. He approached the company that franchised Ben Franklin stores but was rejected blatantly for such a ridiculous idea. So. Walton decided to take the plunge, mortgaged his home, opening his first Wal-Mart (short for Walton Mart) in 1962 in Rogers, Arkansas.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=5-there-was-no-looking-back-for-sam-walton>5.
