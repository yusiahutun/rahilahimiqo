It helps to be the son of a monarch, as it’ll likely get him into <a href=#>Hollywood</a> hotspots and parties the rest of us dream about. One of his pals, Margot Robbie, admitted <a href=#>Prince Harry</a> text her, but she committed the biggest sin when it comes to talking to your friends.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-margot-robbie-and-prince-harry>Margot Robbie and Prince Harry</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p><a href=#>Margot Robbie</a> and Prince Harry met back at Suki Waterhouse’s party, but she later admitted she had no idea who he was.

Unlike me. I write back four days later, weeks later, sometimes.”</p><p>There wasn’t anything romantic going on, and this was before the Duke met <a href=#>Meghan Markle</a>.</p><p>Margot said: “Everyone now thinks if they come on a night out with me in London, they’ll bump into Prince Harry.</p><p>“But I didn’t even know who it was. I’d had a drink, or drinks.
