News</a>. “It was a brief but beautiful ceremony. The waves were crashing and it was a perfect day.”</p><p>Malin and Jack couldn’t keep their hands off of each other during the special event either, but who could blame them? It was their wedding day!&nbsp;“They kissed over and over again. Malin jumped into Jack’s arms and didn’t want to come down,” the source gushed. “Her son&nbsp;Sebastian&nbsp;was there and they each held hands with him and swung him up and down. He was very joyful and laughing throughout. After the ceremony, they took a walk on the beach alone. It was very romantic and they didn’t stop kissing and hugging. They seemed so excited to be married.”</p><p>Malin knew Jack for a long time before they started dating. During a previous appearance on&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener>Live with Kelly and Ryan,</a>&nbsp;the actress explained that he is a friend of her younger sister’s boyfriend and gushed that she fell for him once she noticed how handsome he is.</p><p>“I just kinda looked and him and went, ‘Wow, have you always been this cute?'” she joked. But the deal-breaker was whether or not he would get along with her little boy.&nbsp;“He was brilliant with my son and that was it, and my heart melted,” she said. So cute!</p><p>For more on Malin Akerman, pick up the latest issue of Closer Weekly, on newsstands now — and be sure to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" data-auth=NotApplicable>sign up for our newsletter</a> for more exclusive news!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46mmKWhnmKurLHRppinZZeqwKmx0maYm6elqXq4scOdoKefXam8brbAnKJmnJ%2Bju6a4y7JknrCTocK0tdWeZg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./moms-chocolate-chip-meringues.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>moms chocolate chipmeringues</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./live-like-mole-eco-friendly-michigan-home-built-underground-help-save-money-utilities-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Live like a mole: Eco-friendly Michigan home built UNDERGROUND to help save money on utilities</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./409878-100-summer-instagram-captions-sunny-funny-html.html>100+ summer Instagram captions that are sunny and funny</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-neck-cream.html>19 Best Neck Creams of 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./angelina-jolie-daughter-vivienne-resembles-brad-pitt-new-photo.html>Angelina Jolie's daughter Vivienne looks just like Brad Pitt in new photo from momentous outing toge</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chicagos-summer-smash-festival-signs-a-ticketing-deal-with-dice.html>Chicagos Summer Smash Festival Signs A Ticketing Deal With DICE</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./fosters-voice-reaching-his-peers-with-organization-of-school-club.html>Foster's Voice reaching his peers with organization of school club</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog.
