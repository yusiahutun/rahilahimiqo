I allowed myself to look up to and listen to someone with more success and fame. That was not the right thing to do. I regret it and it won’t happen again. I thought he was a good friend. I was excited that he named a song after me.”</p><p>Judge Paul Engelmayer voiced his displeasure with Kooda’s romanticizing of gang violence in his music, which the government referenced mentioned on tracks such as “Walking Through The Ville,” “Blicky’s Funeral,” “6IX9INE” and “Quagmire.”</p><a class=related-article--container href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static.hiphopdx.com/2023/01/chief-keef-almighty-so-2-album-gets-new-release-date-250x142.png alt="Chief Keef's 'Almighty So 2' Album Gets New Release Date Following Delay" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=related-article--tagline>related<span> news</span></p><h3 class=related-article--title>Chief Keef's 'Almighty So 2' Album Gets New Release Date Following Delay</h3><p class=related-article--meta-information>January 16, 2023</p></a><p>“[A] number of the videos you made prior to your arrest in this case seemed to glorify and promote gangs. You often held a red bandana, a common symbol of the Bloods, and you made hand gestures believed to be gang symbols,” Engelmayer stated on Tuesday (December 1).</p><p>“The government’s sentencing letter reproduces your lyrics, which affirmatively promote violence as you rap about shootings and kidnappings and other violence, and guns. And these videos were made through the summer of 2019, long after you had been charged in this case. I found that disappointing.”</p><p>The judge continiued: “So let me be blunt: you need to grow up and get a more mature perspective on gang activity. If you continue to pursue a career involving rapping and public performances, I hope you will stop romanticizing gang violence.&nbsp;I hope you have learned from this experience that gang violence is not something to celebrate.”</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p>Kooda faced a maximum sentence of life in prison when he was originally arrested in February 2019.</p><p>If his final 54-month sentence included time served, like his co-defendant 6ix9ine’s did, Kooda B still appears to have been released a few months early, as the full sentence would have kept him incarcerated until August 2024.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmigmaW1sLzDsWWcp51ku6bD0miaoaGVm3qsscSfZKygn6TBpr6MpKaonJFir26%2BxKWcmquVmXp3tddyoKed</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./is-nick-hogan-married-what-does-nick-hogan-do-for-a-living.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Is Nick Hogan married?
