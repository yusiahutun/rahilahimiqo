Another employee can be seen telling their masked coworker which kids were good or bad -- at one point telling her, "They're supposed to be cleaning up, monster!"</p><p>The unmasked employee can be seen laughing as well, as the children cry and scream hysterically -- while the one in the mask gets right up in the sobbing kids' faces.</p><p>The videos were reportedly filmed in September 2022 before the owner of the daycare found out about them.</p><p>Oci-Anna Kilburn, Sierra McCandless and Jennifer Newman were each facing five counts of child abuse, per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">WTVA</a>, while Shyenne Shelton had been charged with four counts and Traci Hutson with simple assault against a minor and failure to report abuse.</p><p>Both McCandless and Kilburn plead no-contest and were sentenced almost a year after the incident on Friday to one year in jail and another year of probation. They also must each pay $5,000 in fines and register with central registry so that they cannot work at a daycare facility in the future.</p><p>Both women are appealing their sentences.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:78580468-39c3-40ec-8664-4fa854c61c37 data-container-ref=toofab:article:97bc993a-8b3e-4b07-9270-844ed119c348 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=28><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/fc/5by4/2022/03/10/fc7c9308beac4541bd103c79908ea6bd_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Fox</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Daycare Owner Charged After One of the Nine Children She Left Unsupervised for 12 Minutes Dies: Police</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>Newman, meanwhile, plead guilty to one count of child abuse and the other four counts were remanded. Additionally, her sixth month sentence was suspended. Instead, Newman must attend parenting classes, register with central registry and was given a year of unsupervised probation. Her fines amount to $1,187.75.</p><p>Hutson also plead guilty to one count of simple assault against a minor. The court suspended her sixth month jail sentence and ordered her to donate $1,000 to Full Tummy Project, register with the central registry and pay a fine of $2,337.75.</p><p>However, Shelton's trial is pending the conclusion of another court case, and will go before a judge at a later date.</p><p>For more see our original story below:</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:210a4107-e217-4d4d-a112-78b689812671 data-container-ref=toofab:article:97bc993a-8b3e-4b07-9270-844ed119c348 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/d9/5by4/2022/10/10/d9337e35ae2d4b279d23dcf2d207a107_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Facebook</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Daycare Workers Who Terrified Children with Halloween Masks Charged with Child Abuse</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3R7j3Fma3Bfna6utcutpqdllJbGpK3RnmSwp6KgsrO%2FjK2cq6qZm7amsIycn6KklKeyr3nPrqWiq5iasXA%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./destinys-child-star-michelle-williams-finds-it-disappointing-no-one-recognizes-her.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Destiny's Child star Michelle Williams finds it 'disappointing' no one recognizes her</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./garth-brooks-net-worth.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>ACM Salary, How Much He Makes Per Concert</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./409878-100-summer-instagram-captions-sunny-funny-html.html>100+ summer Instagram captions that are sunny and funny</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-neck-cream.html>19 Best Neck Creams of 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./angelina-jolie-daughter-vivienne-resembles-brad-pitt-new-photo.html>Angelina Jolie's daughter Vivienne looks just like Brad Pitt in new photo from momentous outing toge</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chicagos-summer-smash-festival-signs-a-ticketing-deal-with-dice.html>Chicagos Summer Smash Festival Signs A Ticketing Deal With DICE</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./fosters-voice-reaching-his-peers-with-organization-of-school-club.html>Foster's Voice reaching his peers with organization of school club</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog.
