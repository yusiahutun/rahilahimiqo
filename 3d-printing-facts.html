It creates shapes through layering thermoplastic, much like how a glue gun works. These 3D printers typically create objects from the bottom up.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/facts.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Feature-Image-1-730x410.jpg><h2 class=content-title id=title-2>Stereolithography uses light for 3D printing.</h2><p>For, stereolithography light carves model inside a tub of raw materials. The raw materials used are sensitive to light, hardening as it shines through them. The <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>light</a> cures the raw materials, hardening them layer after layer to form the subject. As each layer is completed, it’s lifted out of the tub, with the model emerging in full once it’s finished.</p><h2 class=content-title id=title-3>Selective Laser Sintering (SLS) is a newer method of 3D printing.</h2><p>As the name suggests, Selective Laser Sintering creates models through using lasers to fuse powdered raw materials into a final form. A common raw material used in this method is nylon. The laser heats the nylon powder to the brink of melting, which makes the material plastic and fusible into the desired shape. The printing process finishes once the model is fully fused.</p><p>Read also: <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal><span>Lyte Gaming Pc</span></a></p><h2 class=content-title id=title-4>Selective Laser Melting (SLM) works like SLS.</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/facts.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/FDM-Printer.jpg><p><span>Since both 3D printing methods use lasers, SLM is often called a sub-type of SLS. However, experts don’t accept this classification. In SLM, lasers actually melt the raw material in layers of around 20 mm thick before welding them together. As they’re welded, they form the pattern of the final subject.</span></p><p><span>Unlike SLS, SLM uses metal powder instead of plastic or synthetic fibers. SLM is actually one of the most common 3D printing methods that use metal.</span></p><h2 class=content-title id=title-5>The most advanced 3D printers can use many kinds of raw materials.</h2><p>Most 3D printers today use only one kind of raw material, such as plastic, cloth, or metal. Now, printing something with multiple kinds of materials requires the final object to be printed one part at a time. After this tedious process, the individual parts are fused together.</p><p>However, scientists are now studying how to make a printer that can use many kinds of raw materials at the same time. Though there’s still a long way to go, the medical field is already looking forward to a final design. Theoretically, 3D printing of pills and other medicines will drastically lower production costs and enable greater quantities.</p><h2 class=content-title id=title-6>3D printing was first used to build tools and prototypes.</h2><p>Initially, 3D printing’s main purpose was for factories and engineers to make replacement tools and parts more efficiently. Early on, 3D printing was also used for making scale prototypes with greater detail and accuracy compared to other methods.</p><p>It wasn’t until the 2010s that high demand and more advanced <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>technology</a> allowed 3D printers to produce complex devices.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/facts.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Iron-Powder.jpg><h2 class=content-title id=title-7>Scientists are looking into 3D printed food.</h2><p>This sounds something out of a sci-fi movie, but it’s true. Scientists today are considering 3D printers as a food source. Currently, 3D printed food is still limited and only works with softer ingredients like cheese, <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>chocolate</a>, and syrup. However, scientists believe that even with those limitations, their work has promise.</p><p>Scientists see potential in 3D printing as a breakthrough for people with special diets and elderly people who can’t eat solid food. NASA is also studying the idea to provide food for their astronauts.</p><h2 class=content-title id=title-8>Global brands are already producing 3D printed clothes and apparel.</h2><p>Much of 3D printing’s role in apparel involves producing prototypes such as women’s underwear or luxury clothes, for fashion designers. However, big brands such as Nike already use 3D printers to make shoes for American football players as of 2020. New Balance also uses 3D printers for custom-made shoes of all <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>sports</a>.</p><h2 class=content-title id=title-9>Intellectual property is a major concern when it comes to 3D printing.</h2><p>Although 3D printing seems to be the future, it also threatens inventors and innovators. Interested individuals and parties have already expressed the downside of 3D printing when it comes to violating patents and copyrights.</p><p>However, courts have since ruled that as long as 3D printed materials aren’t sold or used for profit, then they fall under the law’s fair use conditions.</p><p>Read also: <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal><span>17 Mindblowing Facts About SXP SXP</span></a></p><h2 class=content-title id=title-10>3D printed weaponry is another possible downside of 3D printing.</h2><p>The convenience of 3D printing allows the instant large-scale production of any object – including guns. The government has since expressed concern for how this threatens existing gun regulations. So far, the issue is still protected by existing regulations.</p><p>For example, making guns of your own is illegal if you aren’t a licensed gun owner. It’s also illegal for a single person to make guns for sale. Gun designs owned by the National Rifle Association (NRA) are subjected to additional taxes and another license before you can reproduce them.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/facts.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/3D-Printed-Pottery.jpg><h3>Was this page helpful?</h3><p class=why-trust><span>Our commitment to delivering trustworthy and engaging content is at the heart of what we do.
