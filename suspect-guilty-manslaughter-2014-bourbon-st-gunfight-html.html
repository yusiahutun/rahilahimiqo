Regan rested his case immediately after the prosecution attorneys rested theirs.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>He spent a lengthy closing statement insisting that Le fired in self-defense. He pointed to a hand-drawn diagram of bullet trajectories at the corner of Bourbon and Orleans. He noted evidence that Le fired only four shots to the unknown gunman's 11. And he pointed out that the bullet that killed Thomas is believed to have come from the mystery shooter's gun. He repeatedly re-ran video that he said showed the second shooter had a gun in his outstretched hand when the shooting broke out, a contention prosecutors and a police investigator disputed.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>'Even if it wasn't a gun and my client believed it was a gun, you have a right to shoot in self-defense,' Regan said.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>Assistant District Attorney Tiffany Tucker didn't deny that but said Le's illegal firing of his gun sparked the violence that led to Thomas' death.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>Prosecutors told jurors that a group of Le's friends had been robbed of some marijuana more than an hour before the shooting. Those people later contacted Le, who showed up to Bourbon Street armed and later confronted the robber as he walked by them on Bourbon Street.
