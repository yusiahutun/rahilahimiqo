family in the Georgian style, and it spent most of its life as a stately home before it was needed by Britain of a greater cause.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>The estate was converted to a military hospital during the Second World War and a new ward name the 'Lewis Carroll Unit' was built, named after the village's most famous resident.</span></p><p
