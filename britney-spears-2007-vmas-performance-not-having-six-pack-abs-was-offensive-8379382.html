And while the pop star has already opened up about quite a few notable <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>moments from throughout her career</a> prior to the book’s release, her latest bombshell — which recounts her first return to the stage after shaving her head in 2007 — may be one of the most interesting nuggets from her book, yet.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>getty</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_4-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In a new passage from the memoir, Spears got candid about her performance of “Gimme More” at the 2007 MTV VMAs. In addition to touching on the backlash she received for “not having six-pack abs,” the star also recounted the awkward run-in she had with her ex-boyfriend, Justin Timberlake.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_6-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-square figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>getty</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“It had been a while since I’d seen him,” Britney wrote (via <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Page Six</a>). “Everything was going great in his world. He was at the top of his game in every way, and he had a lot of swagger. I was having a panic attack. I hadn’t rehearsed enough. I hated the way I looked. I knew it was going to be bad.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">She continued, “There was a problem with my costume and with my hair extensions. I hadn’t slept the night before. I was dizzy. It was less than a year since I’d had my second baby in two years, but everyone was acting like my not having six-pack abs was offensive.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Spears added that she “couldn’t believe” she was forced to go on stage considering how she felt, explaining, “I went out there and did the best I could at that moment in time, which — yes, granted — was far from my best at other times. I could see myself on video throughout the auditorium while I performed; it was like looking at myself in a fun-house mirror.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The pop star added that her experience was only made worse by the fact that Justin, who took home the award for Male Artist of the Year, was having a much better night. “Justin glided down the runway," Spears shared. "He was flirting with girls in the audience, including one who turned around and arched her back, shaking her breasts as he sang to her.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Britney and Justin started dating in 1999 before breaking up three years later in 2002. Spears eventually went on to welcome two sons with ex-husband Kevin Federline while Timberlake welcomed two sons with his wife, Jessica Biel.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57waugraaVrnq0vMSaqaxlYmV9eHnVppisZaCav6e70aaYp5uVYruwwIyhmK%2Bhnpx6tLXXZqeam5tirqO%2FjLCYrGWfm7OmutKirZ5laGiEen%2BXaw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./urban-oasis-style.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>An urban oasis of style</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./the-ballad-of-songbirds-and-snakes-release-date-cast-news-spoilers.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>'The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes'</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./409878-100-summer-instagram-captions-sunny-funny-html.html>100+ summer Instagram captions that are sunny and funny</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-neck-cream.html>19 Best Neck Creams of 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./angelina-jolie-daughter-vivienne-resembles-brad-pitt-new-photo.html>Angelina Jolie's daughter Vivienne looks just like Brad Pitt in new photo from momentous outing toge</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chicagos-summer-smash-festival-signs-a-ticketing-deal-with-dice.html>Chicagos Summer Smash Festival Signs A Ticketing Deal With DICE</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./fosters-voice-reaching-his-peers-with-organization-of-school-club.html>Foster's Voice reaching his peers with organization of school club</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog.
