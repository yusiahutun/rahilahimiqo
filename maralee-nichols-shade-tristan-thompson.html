Tristan posted earlier that day with a photo of himself. He captioned the post, “<span class="_aacl _aaco _aacu _aacx _aad7 _aade">I never switched sides, I switched lanes.

I take full responsibility for my actions,” he wrote in a statement via Instagram at the time. The Chicago Bulls basketball player’s confirmation came after weeks of denying rumors that he <a href=#>fathered his third child</a> with the former personal trainer while he was still in a relationship with Khloé. After coming clean, Thompson went on to reveal that he was intending to remain a part of his son’s life. “Now that paternity has been established, I look forward to amicably raising our son,” he said.</p><p><strong><a title="Original URL: https://stylecaster.com/amazon-prime-shows/ Click to follow link." contenteditable=false href=# rel="noopener nofollow">RELATED: Click Here For the Best New Binge-Worthy Shows You Haven’t Seen—But Should&nbsp;</a></strong></p><p>Tristan also apologized to Khloé on his Instagram. “Khloé, you don’t deserve this. You don’t deserve the heartache and humiliation I have caused you. You don’t deserve the way I have treated you over the years. My actions certainly have not lined up with the way I view you. I have the utmost respect and love for you. Regardless of what you may think. Again, I am so incredibly sorry.”</p><p>An insider told <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Us Weekly</a> on July 15, 2022, that Maralee <a href=# rel=noopener>doesn’t care</a> about Tristan and Khloe’s new baby together. “She’s truly focused on raising Theo.” The source also said that Maralee’s main priority is&nbsp; “navigating motherhood as a single mom.” She’s also&nbsp; not “surprised” that Thompson is having more children since the source said that “during their relationship, he told her he wanted five to six children.” Tristan has a son Prince, 5, with ex Jordan Craig, and a daughter True, 4, with Khloé. However, Tristan appears to be absent from Maralee’s son’s life. A rep of Maralee told Us Weekly that Tristan “has done nothing to support their son” since his arrival. “He has not made any attempt to meet their son nor has he provided any financial assistance.</p><p>Khloé, for her part, is still hurt by Tristan for his infidelity and how it happened <a href=# rel=noopener>right before</a> the birth of their surrogate’s baby.&nbsp;“When Khloé found out in December that the surrogate was pregnant, she was elated,” a source told<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">&nbsp;People</a>&nbsp;on July 14, 2022. “Shortly after though, Tristan’s new cheating was exposed. It was a bittersweet situation for Khloé. She was so excited about the baby, but incredibly disappointed in Tristan. Like Khloé always does though, she turned it around and focused on the good.”</p><p>After the birth of their son, sources close to the former couple&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener>confirmed</a> that Khloé will be taking sole custody of their son, but still wants to continue to be co-parents with Tristan. “[Tristan] went through finding a surrogate and all that while he was cheating on [Khloé ] and that’s&nbsp;unforgivable to her,” a source told&nbsp;Us&nbsp;on July 14, 2022. The source continued, “There’s no place in her mind that wants to take Tristan back, she is really done with him romantically this time.”</p><p>The Kardashians&nbsp;is available to stream on&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-orig-url="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=t1ZX7*4ybQA&mid=42392&u1=SC-&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hulu.com%2Fstart" data-ml-id=0 data-ml=true data-xid=fr1660333261859eaf>Hulu</a>.

In the New York Times bestseller, Khloé shares her secrets for finding strength in her body, mind and heart and opens up about her own struggles with her weight and self-image in a “culture that worships skinny.” Along with Khloé’s personal story, the book also features practical advice, recipes and personal anecdotes from Khloé’s life to inspire the reader to “create strength, confidence and true beauty in every facet of your life.” As Khloé writes in Strong Looks Better Naked, “There is no such thing as perfect. Nobody attains perfection. But if you keep trying, you grow and evolve, and to me that’s the point: To be a better person today than I was yesterday; to become the best possible version of myself.”</p><p>Our mission at STYLECASTER is to bring style to the people, and we only feature products we think you’ll love as much as we do.
