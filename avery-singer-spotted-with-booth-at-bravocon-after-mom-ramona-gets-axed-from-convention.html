During the sessions, said Williams, Ramona expressed confusion over why she should avoid saying anything which would include racist tropes, like one saying Black fathers are MIA for their kids.</p><p>"What if they don't have a father? Why can't I say that? Most of them don't," Williams said Ramona asked, before Ramona also allegedly said she read a study confirming her thoughts. Leah McSweeney confirmed Eboni's account with the publication, while Ramona told Vanity Fair she recalled the training being an "open dialogue" and so, "in that spirit, I asked a question about a statistic I had read about single-parent households, where children with single-parent households were statistically less likely to succeed than two-parent households."</p><p>Another incident allegedly happened after Eboni accused Luann De Lesseps and Ramona of showing serious "white fragility" during an argument which aired on the show. Race allegedly continued to be a factor following the tense exchange off-camera, with one VF source claiming Ramona "slammed her hands on the table" and exclaimed, "This is why we didn't need Black people on the show. This is gonna ruin our show."</p><p>Ramona, meanwhile, said that "absolutely" didn't happen, telling the outlet she "supported adding diverse cast members well before" Williams joined the show.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:b391ea3a-fc84-4870-9527-bc795849d78b data-container-ref=toofab:article:ff41e6f4-4dc9-4c21-9668-da435820a511 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=28><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/82/5by4/2023/10/31/82fc8cabc1bd410fb5873163cb7aa9fe_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Bravo</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Kyle Richards' Mother-In-Law Confronts Her Over Split Rumors, Before Fight with Mauricio</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>A Black senior producer for the show, Darian Edmondson, also claimed that following a filmed conversation between Ramona and Eboni, Ramona told Edmondson it reminded her of Jewish colleagues referring to her as "shiksa," which she called a "Catholic slur." When Edmondson said she didn't know the term, she alleges Ramona reacted by saying, "Oh, it's literally like somebody calling you n----r."</p><p>Ramona called that a "misrepresentation" of the conversation, denying she ever said the N-word or that she compared the two experiences.</p><p>Bravo, meanwhile, has yet to address the allegations, with exec, Andy Cohen, seemingly laughing off the report on social media.</p><p>Cohen reacted to a post shared by Bravo fan account, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Watch What Crappens</strong></a>, that poked fun at Bravo viewers wading through the flood of allegations, by simply leaving a crying with laughter emoji in the comments.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:372dd334-b664-4bcb-9048-9080a12e2832 data-container-ref=toofab:article:ff41e6f4-4dc9-4c21-9668-da435820a511 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=28><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/99/5by4/2023/11/02/99cbed0c99094b55b8de90b87f7ec5d5_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Shannon Beador Prepares for BravoCon After Being Sentenced to 3 Years Probation Following DUI Arrest</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>Based on his reaction, it seems unlikely the claims will be addressed at this weekend's convention.</p><a id=gallery-link-bf46df9a-c877-419c-8f6a-c28d72f83f0a class="media-link gallery-block__link js-track-link js-click-gallery" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:gallery:bf46df9a-c877-419c-8f6a-c28d72f83f0a data-context='{"name":"gallery-block","section":"permalink"}' data-container-ref=toofab:article:ff41e6f4-4dc9-4c21-9668-da435820a511 data-gallery-layout=list><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/e5/4by3/2023/04/07/e50dc3ead69e48dba1c3d46ba08999f9_md.jpg width=825 height=618 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3R7kGpmaWtflsOmvthmqqKml5q%2Fbr%2FPqKutnZRixKrAx2aZqKeknXqiwIybqZqun5i8r3nAn6ueql2ivK550ZqkqKaRYrSmwNJmmLGdlGKzs7vMZpqopqaau7W1zqdm</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./jennifer-aniston-reveals-the-one-activity-she-loves-doing-naked.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>¬´&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Jennifer Aniston Reveals To Ellen DeGeneres The One Activity She Loves Doing Naked See What She</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./tag.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;¬ª</span><p class=pager__title>TEG Archives - CelebrityAccess</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./409878-100-summer-instagram-captions-sunny-funny-html.html>100+ summer Instagram captions that are sunny and funny</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-neck-cream.html>19 Best Neck Creams of 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./angelina-jolie-daughter-vivienne-resembles-brad-pitt-new-photo.html>Angelina Jolie's daughter Vivienne looks just like Brad Pitt in new photo from momentous outing toge</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chicagos-summer-smash-festival-signs-a-ticketing-deal-with-dice.html>Chicagos Summer Smash Festival Signs A Ticketing Deal With DICE</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./fosters-voice-reaching-his-peers-with-organization-of-school-club.html>Foster's Voice reaching his peers with organization of school club</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog.
