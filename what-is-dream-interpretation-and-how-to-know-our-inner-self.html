According to him the motivation for our dream comes from our experience throughout the previous day. His theory relies greatly on symbolism.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span><strong>Carl Jung’s view on dream analysis&nbsp;<br></strong></span><span>According to Carl Jung dreams are the representation of our inner self. He believed that dreams are themselves a source of new information and hold a greater understanding of it. He formulated that dreams are formed on the basis of the manifestation of a particular type of archetype. He believed that dreams have signs and signs are known whereas symbols are only known particularly. He didn’t interpret the meaning of the symbols but he believed that exploring the roles of symbols can give a deeper understanding.</span></p><p><span><strong><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.psychologs.com/laravel-filemanager/photos/3358/dream-2nd-L.jpg alt width=1280 height=371 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></strong></span></p><p><span><strong>Meaning of various dreams and the reasons behind</strong></span></p><p><span><strong>Dream about Falling-</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></span><span>In this, the person in the dream experiences a feeling that he/she is falling from a very high building or from some very very top place.

This can result in an increase in heartbeat. Sometimes people instead of real human beings see some kind of terrifying creatures behind them.</span></p><p><span>Reason: In our life, one is ignoring and neglecting a type of problem that should not be ignored.
