class="content post__content clearfix"><p>It’s every actor’s dream to portray a character that people eventually hold dear to their hearts either because their character reminds viewers of a time in their lives, speaks to their inner child, or inspires a new journey.&nbsp;</p><p>An actor who got to live such a reality was Richard Earl Thomas, who played John-Boy, a character who took viewers through both unchartered and familiar experiences with his coming of age story on CBS’ family drama The Waltons.</p><p>He featured<a href=#> on the beloved show</a> from 1972 until his departure in 1977, leaving fans and fellow <a href=# data-type=post data-id=5342>Waltons cast members</a> wondering why Richard Thomas left a show that did a lot for his career as an actor.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=what-was-the-waltons>What was ‘The Waltons’?</h2><p>Based on Earl Hamner’s best-selling novelized memoir Spencer’s Mountain and a 1963 Henry Fonda movie adaptation of the same name, The Waltons is an autobiographical experience story turned into one of the most popular 1970s tv shows.&nbsp;</p><p><a data-amazonimages title="The Foundling" href=# rel="nofollow noopener"><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51fjfXfrCyL._SL500_.jpg alt="The Foundling" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto title='Here is Why Richard Thomas left "The Waltons" 2'></a></p><p>The Waltons revolves around a large family living in rural Virginia during the Depression and World War II.</p><p>The family consists of John and Olivia Walton (Ralph Waite and Michael Learned), their seven children, and John’s parents, Zebulon and Esther Walton (Will Geer and Ellen Corby).</p><p>The story, is in most part, seen through the eyes of John-Boy Walton (Richard Thomas), an aspiring writer and the eldest son. He naturally becomes one of the most attractive aspects of the show, earning him an Emmy award and a Golden Globe nomination.&nbsp;</p><p>Unfortunately, in 1977, after the show’s 5th season and before the show ended, Richard Thomas departed from The Waltons.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=why-did-richard-thomas-leave-the-waltons>Why did Richard Thomas leave The Waltons?</h2><p>Richard Thomas’ departure on The Waltons felt like a swift move by fans, considering how quickly his departure plays out<strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>In moments before his exit, Richard’s John-boy graduates from college and moves to New York City to become an author. Fans eventually find out that he enrolled with the military and became a war correspondent after an attack on Pearl Harbor.</p><p>According to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Distractify</a>, Richard Thomas left The Waltons after season 5 to pursue other career opportunities. At the time of his departure, nothing alluded to a fallout with the show’s producers, considering Richard returned to the show for a few guest appearances in season six.</p><p><a data-amazonimages title="The Waltons: The Complete Second Season" href=# rel="nofollow noopener"><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/m.media-amazon.com/images/I/518J96I5fcL._SL500_.jpg alt="The Waltons: The Complete Second Season" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto title='Here is Why Richard Thomas left "The Waltons" 3'></a></p><p>With Richards’ character still highly relevant, the show’s writers could not bear to have his character appear only so often, so they enlisted a replacement in seasons 8 and 9. Richard was replaced by actor Robert Whiteman who came into the story after John-Boy is involved in a bad plane crash, forcing his return home.&nbsp;</p><p>Despite Robert becoming fully invested in his new character, fans and former co-cast members still complained over losing Richard Thomas as the original John-Boy.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=fans-and-co-stars-react-to-richard-thomas-departure>Fans and co-stars react to Richard Thomas’ departure</h2><p>Actress Micheal Leonard, who played Olivia Walton, was among the cast members who openly expressed how much they missed co-star Richard Thomas. For five seasons, Leonard formed a close bond with her onscreen son, Thomas – with the void felt when he left the show was perfectly understandable.&nbsp;</p><p>This was not the only close bond Olivia actress Micheal Leonard had on the show. Learn more <a href=# data-type=post data-id=5276>about her almost-romance with one of her co-stars</a>.</p><p>According to<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">&nbsp;Outsider</a>, when show creators decided to bring in a replacement, Leonard was not happy about the decision. In a 2015 interview, Leonard revealed it took her a while to watch episodes of The Waltons with the new actor.&nbsp;</p><p>“I couldn’t — there were too many memories,” she said.&nbsp;</p><p><a data-amazonimages title="The Pledge" href=# rel="nofollow noopener"><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61+Z6es07cL._SL500_.jpg alt="The Pledge" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto title='Here is Why Richard Thomas left "The Waltons" 4'></a></p><p>“I had never really seen that young man (Robert Wightman). And I think maybe I had done one of two shows with him before I left, which was very awkward. I felt sorry for him on the set and, to be honest. I didn’t feel it was right to have a different John-Boy with a different face and voice. But you know, when I saw that episode, I thought it was very good and that he did a nice job!” she continued.</p><p>Leonard was not the only one who faced a hard time letting go of Richard. The series creator, Earl Hamner Jr., constantly heaped praise about Richard’s performance even after concluding John-Boy’s storyline. “He was marvelous, and as it turned out, he was perfect in the role,” Earl told&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"><strong><u>MeTV.</u></strong></a>&nbsp;“I often said he made a better John-Boy than I did being me. He was just perfect.”&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=richard-thomas-reacts-to-leaving-the-waltons>Richard Thomas reacts to leaving The Waltons</h2><p>When leaving The Waltons, Richard expressed gratitude for been allowed to play a character that was “very rich,” stating, “there are no words to express what I owe Earl Hamner,” in an interview.&nbsp;</p><p>In the same tone, he also felt compassion for the actor who was hired to replace him, as per Outsider. “I felt for Bobby (Robert Wightman) because he’s such a good actor and such a good guy,” Thomas told Studio 10. “I thought, ‘Oh, man is that a job I would have wanted to take? But, you know, it took guts, and he did it.”&nbsp;</p><p>After leaving The Waltons, he ironically went on to have a family the size of his onscreen family. He had the same number of kids (seven kids) as John, and Olivier Walton had on the show.&nbsp;</p><p>Professionally, after leaving the CBS family drama series Thomas went on to star on a plethora of other roles including, Roots: The Next Generations, Promised Land, The Adventures of Swiss Family Robinson, It’s a Miracle, Just Cause, The Americans, Billions, Tell Me Your Secrets, NCIS: New Orleans, to mention a few.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLjOrKqynpmasW%2BvzqZmsKCpYrGqsIyroJygkaexbsDHqKSaq12hsqLCxGaroZ1drK6twM6nqmg%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./music-in-paranoid-times-episode-18-ft-pual-koehler-drummer-mngmt-silverstein.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Music In Paranoid Times: Episode 18 Ft.
