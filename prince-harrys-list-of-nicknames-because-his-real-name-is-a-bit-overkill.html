Although it’s unlikely anyone, especially <a href=#>Meghan Markle</a> addresses him that way. Let’s take a look at his nicknames, and who calls him what.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/10/GettyImages-1688040248-683x1024.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-prince-harry-s-nicknames-explored>Prince Harry’s nicknames explored</h2><p>So, what does Meghan call her husband? She’s known to call <a href=#>Prince Harry</a> Haz, according to a number of TV appearances. Whilst ‘Haz’ was on an open-top bus with James Corden on the Late Late Show, Meghan dialed in, calling her husband the shortened version of the name. However, it seems she’s the only one with the ‘permission’ to do this.</p><p>“Haz? I didn’t know we were calling you ‘Haz’ now,” Corden said, to which Harry replied, “You’re not my wife.”</p><p>If ‘Haz’ wasn’t short enough, the Duchess also calls her husband, H, as stated in their <a href=#>Netflix</a> docuseries. She also referred to him as H on an appearance on the Ellen DeGeneres Show.</p><p>So we know what his wife calls him, but what exactly does his family, including his brother <a href=#>Prince William</a> call him?</p><p>It appears that his family calls him Harold, as mentioned in his memoir, Spare. Whilst <a href=#>making remarks about Meghan</a>, Harry claimed his brother said: “She’s an actress after all, Harold. Anything can happen.” In his memoir, the 39-year-old recently confessed to being “a bit hurt” by the remarks.</p><p>But they’re not the only names Harold has. Last but not least, in the army, he was called Harry Wales.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-other-royal-nicknames>Other royal nicknames</h2><p>Harry isn’t the only member of the <a href=#>royal</a> family that has a nickname. In one that’s known to most people, <a href=#>Kate Middleton</a>‘s full name is Catherine.</p><p>Harry’s given <a href=#>Prince William</a> the nickname of “Willy,” as referred to in his memoir. To us, they’re William and Harry, but to each other, they’re Willy and Harold.</p><p>However, it’s not only the youngsters who have nicknames for each other. <a href=#>Queen Elizabeth II</a> had a cute <a href=#>nickname from Prince Phillip</a>.</p><p>In an unlikely but adorable nickname, in their 70 years of marriage, the Duke of Edingburgh referred to his wife, the Queen as “cabbage.”</p><p>Cute!</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFsZmpoX2WGcLzRoqWcnV2drrO%2B2KxkpaGjqXqwsoynoJyjnpa6pr%2BMm5ycmaWosm60yKxkq52RoXqvrcyeZKKrXZZ6o7XTZqavnaKgtq24jg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./shirtless-woody-harrelson-54-strips-puts-trim-torso-display-works-sweat-soccer-pitch-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Shirtless Woody Harrelson, 54, strips off and puts his trim torso on display</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./best-april-fools-day-jokes.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Best April Fools' Day Jokes Funny Spring Jokes</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./409878-100-summer-instagram-captions-sunny-funny-html.html>100+ summer Instagram captions that are sunny and funny</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-neck-cream.html>19 Best Neck Creams of 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./angelina-jolie-daughter-vivienne-resembles-brad-pitt-new-photo.html>Angelina Jolie's daughter Vivienne looks just like Brad Pitt in new photo from momentous outing toge</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chicagos-summer-smash-festival-signs-a-ticketing-deal-with-dice.html>Chicagos Summer Smash Festival Signs A Ticketing Deal With DICE</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./fosters-voice-reaching-his-peers-with-organization-of-school-club.html>Foster's Voice reaching his peers with organization of school club</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog.
