That word came late Friday afternoon, just ten days after Walmart announced it would not build a superstore in Rock Island. Thomas was involved in trying to land that business for the city.</span></span></p><p><span><span>In an email to Local 4 News, Thomas said “I will be stepping down to pursue other opportunities in local government management.”&nbsp;Thomas tells Local 4 News he will likely not stay in the Quad Cities, saying “Many of the local government management opportunities I am pursuing will require me to leave the Quad Cities.”</span></span></p><p><span><span>Some people were surprised to hear about Thomas leaving his job in Rock Island. Others say this is just the first chip to fall in the aftermath of the failed Walmart deal.</span></span></p><p><span><span>“Personally I think more people need to step down,” said Patrick Rifley, a Quad Citian who works in Rock Island. Strong words as rock island residents say they’re still reeling from the city’s botched Walmart plans.</span></span></p><p><span><span>“It’s too bad it wouldn’t work but it would’ve been a good idea. But I was skeptical about it from the get-go,” said Tom Marshall, a Rock Island resident.</span></span></p><p><span><span>“I just think it’s absolutely horrible. They could’ve spent that money in a lot better places. There’s a lot of small businesses that could’ve used 15 million dollars, versus destroying a whole neighborhood for something that’s not going to happen,” said Rifley.</span></span></p><p><span><span>Walmart is just the tip of the iceberg. Many people are upset about the direction the city is going in lately, saying they’re ready for a shakeup in city government.</span></span></p><p><span><span>“I think anything would be a good thing. Anything that shakes what’s going on now because obviously the city leaders aren’t getting it done,” said Rifley.</span></span></p><p><span><span>City manager Thomas Thomas plans to leave his job next Tuesday. &nbsp;This news comes after Rock Island’s Economic Development Director, Jeff Eder, left last month.</span></span></p><span><span>Thomas has been City Manager for almost five years. Council will vote on approving his resignation and severance plan at their <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">meeting Monday</a>. City staff say his contract was due to expire next month. Part of his <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">severance package</a> includes six months of pay and a “favorable reference letter” from Mayor Dennis Pauley.</span></span><p><span><span>Even as the dust continues to settle from the failed Walmart store, Rock Island residents say right now, optimism is their only choice.</span></span></p><p><span><span>“Rock Island’s bigger than 11th Street,” said Marshall.</span></span></p><p><span><span>Rock Island city council members declined to speak on camera Friday night, but did confirm they were aware of Thomas’ plans to leave because it was discussed in a closed meeting. One council member tells Local 4 a lot of factors led to Thomas stepping down… Political backlash being a big one.</span></span></p><p><span><span>Local 4 asked Pauley if he plans on running for re-election; he said “I am keeping my options open.”</span></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7sMHRqqyanJOewaqx0meaqKVfo7K4v46rppyjXZ7Ara3NnWSrnaOesaa606xkq52RmMFuwM5mmqKsqWK6orrAoJyrq12nsrS1xqeYraGfo3w%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./uks-most-wanted-murder-suspects-32051664.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>UK's most wanted murder suspects from earless pub shooter to gangland enforcer, 'Mr Big'</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./kurt-russell-jennifer-jason-leigh-hateful-eight-interview.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Kurt Russell and Jennifer Jason Leigh Talk About The Hateful Eight</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./409878-100-summer-instagram-captions-sunny-funny-html.html>100+ summer Instagram captions that are sunny and funny</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-neck-cream.html>19 Best Neck Creams of 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./angelina-jolie-daughter-vivienne-resembles-brad-pitt-new-photo.html>Angelina Jolie's daughter Vivienne looks just like Brad Pitt in new photo from momentous outing toge</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chicagos-summer-smash-festival-signs-a-ticketing-deal-with-dice.html>Chicagos Summer Smash Festival Signs A Ticketing Deal With DICE</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./fosters-voice-reaching-his-peers-with-organization-of-school-club.html>Foster's Voice reaching his peers with organization of school club</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog.
