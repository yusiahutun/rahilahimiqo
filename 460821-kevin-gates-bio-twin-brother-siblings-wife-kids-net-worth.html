The three had collaborated on his first mixtape. Gates and Boosie were incarcerated in separate cases in 2008; hence their music career was put on hold. Gates served a sentence of 31 months but was released early for good behaviour.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/10dd7c40cf42d98f.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Who is Fabio Jackson?
