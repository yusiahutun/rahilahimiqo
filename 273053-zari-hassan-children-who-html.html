How many children does the renowned socialite have? Zari's relationships and marriages have been publicised like no other. Therefore, little about them is unknown to the public. Nonetheless, here is what you probably did not know about the singer and her children.</p><h2>Who are Zari Hassan's children?</h2><p class=align-left>Zari has been married three times. She was first married to the late tycoon Ivan Ssemwanga. When he died, the <a href=#>socialite</a> tied the knot with Tanzanian hitmaker Diamond. Unfortunately, their marriage was brief and ended in 2018.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/8cff9a3b558eb1b1.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Esther Passaris Defends Cyrus Jirongo for Urging Men to Introduce Their Wives to Their Mpango Wa Kandos</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Zari and Diamond's <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">marriage ended </a>becauseof what she revealed as infidelity issues. She said she knew of Diamond's infidelity but chose to remain silent for peace. When their marriage ended in 2018, she got into a relationship with Shakib Lutaya, to whom she is now married.</p><h2>How many kids does Zari have?</h2><p class=align-left>Zari has five children—three from her first marriage to Ivan Ssemwanga and two from Diamond Platnumz. Besides being a socialite and a businesswoman, she finds time for all her children.</p><p class=align-left>The singer met Ivan in late 2000, and they dated for a while before formalising their union in 2004. Her <a href=#>marriage</a> to Ivan brought forth three boys. Their sons’ names are Raphael, Quincy, and Pinto Ssemwanga.</p><p class=align-left>Unfortunately, their marriage was faced with allegations of toxicity and abuse. As a result, Zari decided to walk out of the union in 2014. She had tried to mend the relationship, but it was all in vain. She takes care of Ivan Ssemwanga’s three other kids.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/db369f5b130cc878.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=29><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Diamond Excited as Zuchu Gifts Him Card, Flowers on Father's Day After He's Ignored by His Baby Mamas</span></p></a><h3>1.
