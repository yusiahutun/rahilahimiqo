To start, click<strong> Calculate Prize</strong> on the home page to see how much you can win. Healthy Wage will ask you to input how much weight you want to lose, the amount of time you need to lose the weight, and how much money you're willing to bet on yourself.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>The more weight you want to lose, the higher your cash prize goes. You can also earn more money by placing a higher bet on yourself. Although you'll have to pay to partake in this contest, it's worth it if you manage to lose the weight. At the end of the challenge, you have to film a video of your final weigh-in to earn your prize.</p><p>Healthy Wage also gives teams the option to lose weight together.</p><p>In the <a href=#>Next Team Challenge</a>, teams of five can compete to lose the most weight. If you manage to keep your weight down after six months pass, Healthy Wage will return your entry fee.</p><p>The Next Team Challenge requires you to pay $25 per month if you're participating with a company, or $33 per month if you're not associated with one---either way, your team can win a <strong>$10,000 prize</strong>.</p><h2 id=dietbet>4. <a href=#>DietBet</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/dietbet-challenge.png><p>DietBet gives you the chance to split a pool of cash with other successful contestants. It's just like gambling, except you're betting on your own fitness. You must enter a bet into the pool each month to ensure that you won't go off track and fail to meet your goals.</p><p>In other words, you better get on a fitness program or download some <a href=#>free workout apps</a>, otherwise, you might lose some cash.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>You can choose from several different challenges on DietBet.</p><p>You'll see some games that have thousands of players, while others only have dozens. With more players, you'll likely have a shot at winning more cash (just keep in mind that you'll have to share it with other winners).</p><p>Each game has different goals as well---some invite you to lose 4% of your weight in four weeks, and some encourage a larger amount.</p><p>If you want to create a challenge among a group of friends and family, DietBet lets you do that too. Establish your own game and see who loses the most weight.
