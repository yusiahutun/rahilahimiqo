"He's a master. I think he just sets the tone for his fans, for his bands, for his opening acts, for all of his crew. He knows how to just live and breathe everything he stands for from top to bottom. So, you can really learn a lot from being on tour with him."</p><p>Old Dominion first joined Chesney on the road for his 2014 Big Revival Tour. They've since opened for him on 2016's Spread the Love Tour, 2018's Trip Around the Sun Tour and 2022's Here and Now Tour. They were also set to be featured on his 2020 Chillaxification Tour before it was postponed by COVID-19.</p><p>The band has also embarked on their share of headlining tours, and they will kick off their 2023 No Bad Vibes Tour, which was <a href=#>inspired by Chesney</a>, on Jan. 19. They are taking along Kassi Ashton, Frank Ray, Greylan James, Steven Lee Olsen and Shawn Austin as openers, but the&nbsp;group says there's always a chance their buddy Chesney will show up unexpectedly.</p><p>"You never know with that guy," says Ramsey. "When he shows up to our shows, we don't know, literally, until we're onstage and somebody gets in our ear and says, 'Hey, Kenny is here.' So, you never know."</p><p>The No Bad Vibes&nbsp;Tour will visit cities in the U.S. and Canada through June 30.</p><p>Old Dominion&nbsp;are also busy releasing new music: They shared their new single, "<a href=#>Memory Lane,"&nbsp;</a>on Jan. 5, and they released an additional three songs — "Ain't Got a Worry," "Freedom Like You" and "Easier Said With Rum" — on Jan. 9.</p><p><h2 class=photogallery-title>10 Things You Didn't Know About Kenny Chesney:</h2></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskajBprvFnKaupqSnxm%2BvzqZmqKSUYrGwucinoKimXay1osCMpJynpqlisKmx0qecsmWUpLK0ecGeq62domLBqa3NZpinsZ%2BjsnA%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./saif-ahmed-belhasa.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Saif Ahmed Belhasa</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./katie-findlay-bio-facts-instagram-net-worth-dating-boyfriend.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Katie Findlay Bio, Facts, Instagram, Net Worth, Dating, Boyfriend</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./409878-100-summer-instagram-captions-sunny-funny-html.html>100+ summer Instagram captions that are sunny and funny</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-neck-cream.html>19 Best Neck Creams of 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./angelina-jolie-daughter-vivienne-resembles-brad-pitt-new-photo.html>Angelina Jolie's daughter Vivienne looks just like Brad Pitt in new photo from momentous outing toge</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chicagos-summer-smash-festival-signs-a-ticketing-deal-with-dice.html>Chicagos Summer Smash Festival Signs A Ticketing Deal With DICE</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./fosters-voice-reaching-his-peers-with-organization-of-school-club.html>Foster's Voice reaching his peers with organization of school club</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog.
