While there are stylish options on the market with tech to prevent visible panty lines, compression to smooth your tummy, and colorways to match your <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>sports bras</a>, equally as important is your fabric of choice.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">“Two main factors to consider in terms of workout underwear are material and breathability,” board-certified gynecologist Dr. Karen Tang tells InStyle. “You want to minimize moisture and friction which can be irritating to sensitive vulva skin. This is especially important when it’s hot or humid, or for activities like biking or spinning where the vulva can get particularly irritated. With exercise, you may want to go slightly looser than usual for underwear sizing, to avoid friction with running or other rapid movements,” she says.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We took into consideration tips from Dr. Tang, as well as recommendations from OB/GYNs Dr. Iurchenko Olena and Dr. Hina Cheema.

(It’s the third-most best-selling item on the site, after a pair of faux-leather leggings and a sculpting bra.) With light to moderate compression and zero seams, the panty, made from a microfiber blend, is smoothing, and there’s a 100% cotton gusset for comfort. It’s resistant to pilling and also machine washable, which makes things easy when you’re ready for another workout stat.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>XS–3X | <strong>Material: </strong>Nylon, elastane | <strong>Cut: </strong>Brief</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-budget-fruit-of-the-loom-womens-plus-fit-for-me-breathable-micro-mesh-brief-panty></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Budget</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Fruit of the Loom Women’s Plus Fit For Me Breathable Micro-Mesh Brief Panty</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Fruit of the Loom Women&amp;acirc;s Plus Fit For Me Breathable Micro-Mesh Brief Panty" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/GRI4QSTEBrJdrRa5m7EewSwveV0=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/fruit-of-the-loom--womens-plus-fit-for-me-breathable-micro-mesh-brief-panty--c4019b9f671c40a29e80b2ec4ff76de3.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Fruit of the Loom</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The style is tag-free and very lightweight with full coverage.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>Some wearers say the fabric feels too thin for their liking or that the waistband height varies depending on the pair.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">According to Jernigan these panties are comfortable and fit like a dream. Plus, they’re super-affordable with a 10-pack ringing in at less than $30. With many color options, from classic black and white to shades of purple, these micro-mesh briefs offer full coverage and have a breathable waistband.

With raw cut edges that are designed to hide under any outfit, the design is a best seller with wicking properties to keep you dry. What’s more, it comes in 12 colorways ranging from neutrals to cool, ethereal shades.

With strong compression, the perfectly stretchy design cinches the waist without any panty lines. We also love that there’s a wider crotch for added coverage, and interior silicone comprising the waistband to prevent rolling.

Being that most leggings are body-conscious, behaving like a second skin, a thong is usually preferable, and this one is spot-on for everyday activity — especially if you’re running errands or grabbing brunch after a workout class.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>XS–4XL | <strong>Material: </strong>Nylon, elastane, recycled nylon | <strong>Cut: </strong>Thong</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-yoga-lululemon-underease-super-high-rise-shortie-underwear-5></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best for Yoga</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Lululemon UnderEase Super-High-Rise Shortie Underwear</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Lululemon UnderEase Super-High-Rise Shortie Underwear 5&amp;quot;" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/FPEnG8syb1-xWGCA1HaWOPY7Du4=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/lululemon-underease-super-high-rise-shortie-underwear-5-e5ab09f83f2648759b6cbc97aac06581.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Lululemon</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>They come in a two-pack and the fabric is derived from responsibly sourced wood-based materials.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>Since the material is thin, some shoppers report that the white shade is see-through.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">These soft underwear shorts are extremely breathable and flexible — basically, all you’d want for yoga. In a silky-soft fabric that’s sweat-wicking and has a four-way stretch, the 5-inch length means you’ll be comfortable striking all of your poses without worrying about anything riding up. Wear them under sweatpants or as is and stay comfortable with the chafe-resistant seams and smooth waistband that doesn’t dig in while you’re stretching out.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>XS–XXL | <strong>Material: </strong>Modal, elastane | <strong>Cut: </strong>High-rise shorts</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-pilates-victorias-secret-logo-cotton-shortie-panty></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best for Pilates</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Victoria’s Secret Logo Cotton Shortie Panty</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Victoria&amp;acirc;s Secret Logo Cotton Shortie Panty" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/1lB2k5Bm0j8M4gdydwospmwDZC0=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/victorias-secret--logo-cotton-shortie-panty-8acbd60a0f8b4657a5962d43d2b795de.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>Victoriaâs Secret&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>You can choose the width of your waistband depending on your chosen print or colorway, and if you buy in bulk, you save.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>Some shoppers report issues with washing, from loose seams to thinning fabric.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Victoria’s Secret has long been a trusted brand for underwear, and the brand’s cotton shorties are a consistent best seller. Offering just the right amount of coverage, the mid-rise cut is secured with a classic logo waistband, and you can choose between thin or thicker bands. A Pilates workout involves plenty of movement and position shifting, so the added coverage of a shortie, as opposed to a thong or bikini, is preferable.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>XS–XXL | <strong>Material: </strong>Cotton, modal, elastane | <strong>Cut: </strong>Boyshort</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-running-caterlove-womens-seamless-underwear-no-show-stretch-bikini-panties></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best for Running</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Caterlove Women’s Seamless Underwear No Show Stretch Bikini Panties</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Caterlove Women&amp;acirc;s Seamless Underwear No Show Stretch Bikini Panties" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/llR5JLUWYn61APe5ta4RsBGKxVc=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/caterlove--womens-seamless-underwear-no-show-stretch-bikini-panties-814d2b5da0d644b69943ad89a1167f48.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The style is available in four multi-pack assortments at an affordable price point.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>Some users report that the underwear rides down a bit when they sit.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">For running and active training, it’s best to look for breathable stretch underwear that doesn’t ride up or cause chafing. It’s also smart to invest in multi-packs, as running gear is often replaced since it’s a high-intensity sport. For that reason, a pack you can re-order quickly at a low price point is key. With over 1,500 reviews on Amazon, this pack is best-selling and customers say that they appreciate the seamless appearance when they’re on the go (no visible panty lines here!)</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-31 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>XS–XL | <strong>Material: </strong>Nylon, spandex | <strong>Cut: </strong>Hipster bikini</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-sweat-wicking-knix-zones-ultra-leakproof-high-rise></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Sweat-Wicking</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Knix Zones+ Ultra Leakproof High-Rise</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Knix Zones+ Ultra Leakproof High-Rise" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/suxSlUqfLv5u_G2xbsm1sGIJvGo=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/knix--zones--ultra-leakproof-high-rise--1d576a9a609c4b7a94083409d79caf71.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Knix&nbsp;</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>There are moisture-absorbing panels extending to the waistband at the back; yet, it still washes like regular underwear.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>The higher price point.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Bondy says that when she teaches yoga, she wears this “period” underwear to stop the “swamp crotch.” As someone who looks for moisture-wicking and fast-drying materials with odor absorption tech, she says they feel particularly fresh. Meanwhile, Dr. Cheema would approve of Knix’s fabric being 70% nylon, as it works to draw moisture away from the vulva. This underwear is designed to feel snug, but with a relaxed fit, and has over 5,500 reviews and 4.5 stars to prove its protective coverage and support.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-35 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>XS–XXXXL | <strong>Material: </strong>Nylon, spandex | <strong>Cut: </strong>High-rise with medium coverage</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-cotton-gap-organic-stretch-cotton-bikini></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Cotton</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Gap Organic Stretch Cotton Bikini</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Gap Organic Stretch Cotton Bikini" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/_f5n49K6zXB4gSOsOXkCFhPQR1E=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/gap--organic-stretch-cotton-bikini-059fc7e8cfc1430f94b530052e056352.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Gap</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>Sustainable choice with great reviews on fit.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>Only available in three shades; sizing runs small according to customers.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-38 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you don’t sweat much while working out, cotton underwear is for you. It’s breathable, which promotes air circulation, and it’s hypoallergenic, according to Dr. Cheema. Gap’s underwear in particular is made from organic cotton, which is grown without the use of harmful pesticides and fertilizers. It can be thrown in the machine for an easy wash, and most reviewers give these five stars for a great fit.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-39 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>XXS–XXL | <strong>Material: </strong>Organic cotton, spandex | <strong>Cut: </strong>Bikini</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-plus-size-lane-bryant-comfort-bliss-high-waist-brief-panty></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Plus-Size</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Lane Bryant Comfort Bliss High-Waist Brief Panty</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Lane Bryant Comfort Bliss High-Waist Brief Panty" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/K0nhzJudECmAG2guqFStNkvyOfU=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/lane-bryant--comfort-bliss-high-waist-brief-panty--3e5a290c6f4b49a1ac2ec6244c9daabb.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Lane Bryant&nbsp;</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>Not only are they extra-soft, but they also come in a wide range of colors and prints.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>The waistband becomes less stable after washing.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-42 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Both Bondy and Jernigan consider Lane Bryant a go-to for plus-size workout underwear, with Bondy touting this Comfort Bliss style as the perfect high-waist pair. “I have a tummy so I want that extra coverage to ensure that I’m not constantly fidgeting with my clothing. If the foundation is terrible, expect to have an unproductive workout,” she told InStyle. With a range of colors and even fun, splashy patterns, many of these styles also come with matching full-coverage bras that are just as supportive as the underwear. The panties are made from extra-soft brushed fabric with 360 degrees of stretch, and the full coverage silhouette means there won’t be any rolling at the waistband or digging at the top of the thigh near the gusset.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-43 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>14/16–38/40 | <strong>Material: </strong>Nylon, spandex | <strong>Cut: </strong>High-waist brief</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-bikini-fabletics-no-show-mid-rise-bikini></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Bikini</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Fabletics No Show Mid-Rise Bikini</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Fabletics No Show Mid-Rise Bikini" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/9coEQPLi6NiRmD20PQqd_DLUOIE=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/fabletics--no-show-mid-rise-bikini-5f69919106684ae6b64a2815bb287125.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Fabletics&nbsp;</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>You can save up to 80% if you become a Fabletics member with your purchase.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>Some people say the crotch area is narrow for a brief, almost veering into thong territory.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-46 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">With hundreds of positive reviews, this is the best-selling bikini underwear at Fabletics that is ultra-soft and described as “barely there.” They’re low-rise, so if you’re not in a high-rise legging, they’ll still work with your outfit. Most people are delightfully surprised upon reviewing them that they really are a no-show style, as such a claim can be difficult to prove. We love that they come in six different shades with two limited edition colors if you’re trying to collect as many as possible.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-47 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>XXS–4X | <strong>Material: </strong>Polyamide, elastane | <strong>Cut: </strong>Mid-rise bikini</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-boyshort-tomboyx-boy-shorts></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Boyshort</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>TomboyX Boy Shorts</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="TomboyX Boy Shorts" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/Kimgpg7D3CcTpWIduQqNwZtFqDM=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/tomboyx--boy-shorts-982ccc0c66a249449edefe568d2a4dfd.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>TomboyX</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>Sustainable, available in a wide variety of colors and sizes.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>Some shoppers report the banding around the thigh is too thick or tight.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-50 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">These boyshorts are famous for a wedgie-free fit and the waistband doesn’t ride up or down, even though it’s made from a super-silky soft fabric.

A material that combines natural and synthetic threads are sweat-wicking to prevent unpleasant odors and irritation to the skin. So, in this case, look for high nylon, polyester, or cotton percentages. (<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Victoria’s Secret Logo Cotton Shortie Panty</a> is perhaps the best example of this — it's made of cotton and modal with a high spandex content for a super smooth fit.) However, in general, airy, lightweight fabrics are best.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Cut</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Whatever your chosen cut — be it a low-rise brief, thong, or high-waist bikini — it should stretch well so that your movements are not restricted during activity. If you’re unsure which cut is right for you, remember that great workout underwear follows the curves of your body, so try to match up a silhouette to your natural figure. No matter what shape you favor, internal seams, gusset overlays, and waistbands should not be rough against the skin, irritating, or constricting — so be sure to test out these details before undergoing a long workout in new underwear you’ve never tried before.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Size</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Never take on a workout in underwear that feels too small. “Workout underwear should fit snugly without squeezing the body,” Olena says. So, how do you know if you’ve bought the wrong size? “If there are marks on the skin after training, consider choosing a larger size.” If you’re in a size too large, your clothing may bunch at the waist and hips, causing discomfort throughout the workout.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-your-questions-answered></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Your Questions, Answered</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>How often should you replace your workout underwear?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Most gynecologists and health experts recommend refreshing your workout underwear drawer every 6 to 12 months, depending on workout intensity. However, key factors to take into consideration include the cleanliness of your undergarments due to proper washing methods. If you usually engage in high-intensity activities that result in excessive sweating, you should look out for stretched elastic or lingering odors even after wash, which indicates it’s time for a refresh. Olena recommends using daily pads to protect the elements of your underwear for longer. Of course, changing out of your workout underwear immediately after physical activity is a must — and you should take a shower, afterward, too. “Prolonged moisture is a breeding ground for yeast infection,” Dr. Cheema says.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>What workout underwear should you wear in warm and cold climates?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Properties you should look for in workout underwear for warm weather include lightweight or moisture-wicking fabric to avoid overheating. In colder climates, moisture-wicking is still important, as dampness can make you feel even colder at low temperatures, but you should also choose styles that provide insulation or warmth. In other words, don’t be afraid to opt for thicker underwear.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>What are the best workout underwear brands?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">While there are plenty of brands that make best-selling underwear for movement (Lululemon, Athleta, Fabletics, and MeUndies, to name a few), Dr. Cheema reminds us that it’s less about the brand and more about the material — which is why we’re here to shed light on the specs. If you’re trying to save and are opting for a lesser-known brand, Dr. Cheema advises to look out for leaking dyes, since some may contain chemicals that can be irritating to sensitive skin, causing inflammation or allergic reactions when there is prolonged exposure.<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-why-shop-with-us></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Why Shop With Us</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Sarah Wasilak</a> is a published writer, podcast host, and the Associate Director of Commerce at Popsugar.
