Sheridan was also reportedly in their circle.</p><p class=quote-block__text>Sometimes, I'm just tired of words, so let's beat the s--t out of each other. "</p><p>But the pair weren't exactly fast friends.

I've probably been in one on every continent."</p><p>He added of fighting, "I don't think there's anything wrong with fighting. Sometimes, I'm just tired of words, so let's beat the s--t out of each other. Maybe at the end of it you'll buy me a Guinness and I'll buy you a Bushmills, and we'll be done. It's kind of what guys do."</p><p>Hauser also called Sheridan, 53, "a really intense guy" during a 2020 <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>interview on Ryen Russillo's podcast</strong></a>.</p><p>"He's one of those guys who works his a-- off 'til it's over, and when it's over, he likes to have a nice drink and enjoy himself," Hauser said.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:ba312235-cc2d-4331-8ee9-f90326680c87 data-container-ref=toofab:article:7abdfc6f-2cf2-4ad7-b8a7-a6dedd87db6e data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/ef/5by4/2023/04/13/ef26adf58e564cae86ff3b4861d62ead_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Yellowstone Co-Stars Ryan Bingham & Hassie Harrison Confirm Off-Screen Relationship</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>The 48-year-old actor's comments come after news broke that Sheridan's Bosque Ranch is suing Hauser's coffee brand, Free Rein.</p><p>The lawsuit was filed in the Northern District of Texas' federal court in San Angelo Nov. 21 by the ranch against Free Rein, for trademark infringement.</p><p>It cited unfair competition and false advertising in the filing.</p><p>Per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" title=https://sanangelolive.com/news/business/2023-11-28/yellowstone-creator-sues-san-angelo-based-coffee-company><strong>San Angelo Live</strong></a>, the suit claimed that Free Rein uses "a brand mark strikingly similar to Bosque Ranch's registered trademark, potentially misleading consumers."</p><p>Hauser isn't the only one to get into it with Sheridan. In fact, the Yellowstone world has been riddled with drama in the last year, with Sheridan and Costner also in the midst of a rumored ongoing feud, which came after Costner left the show last year.</p><p>While many rumors swirled about what really went down between the pair, Sheridan told <a href=#><strong>The Hollywood Reporter</strong><strong> in June</strong></a>, that Costner wanted to leave the show to work on his passion project, an epic Western tentatively titled, Horizon.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:ae073bd3-4fac-4cdc-9c54-d5f06ba2e9b5 data-container-ref=toofab:article:7abdfc6f-2cf2-4ad7-b8a7-a6dedd87db6e data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/4c/5by4/2023/09/07/4cf80ed63d0547718b1b34db0e62853e_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Instagram</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">8 Famous Parents Who Dropped Their Kids Off At College This Year</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>"My last conversation with Kevin was that he had this passion project he wanted to direct," Sheridan told the outlet. "He and the network were arguing about when he could be done with Yellowstone. I said, 'We can certainly work a schedule toward [his preferred exit date],' which we did."</p><p>While the showrunner maintained that he still respects Costner as an actor, he said matters between them have become complicated as other people have gotten involved.</p><p>"I've never had an issue with Kevin that he and I couldn't work out on the phone," Sheridan said. "But once lawyers get involved, then people don't get to talk to each other and start saying things that aren't true and attempt to shift blame based on how the press or public seem to be reacting... His movie seems to be a great priority to him and he wants to shift focus."</p><p>"I sure hope [the movie is] worth it," he added.</p><a id=gallery-link-6bbdaa18-74a3-4539-aae5-d26f619dc295 class="media-link gallery-block__link js-track-link js-click-gallery" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:gallery:6bbdaa18-74a3-4539-aae5-d26f619dc295 data-poster-image-ref=toofab:image-asset:image_jpg_20231207_4325c56240cb4a5c8bfe457c1721097f data-start-at-poster data-context='{"name":"gallery-block","section":"permalink"}' data-container-ref=toofab:article:7abdfc6f-2cf2-4ad7-b8a7-a6dedd87db6e data-gallery-layout=carousel><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/43/4by3/2023/12/07/4325c56240cb4a5c8bfe457c1721097f_md.jpg width=825 height=618 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class="media-credit gallery-block__media-credit">Todd Williamson/January Images/Shutterstock</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3R7kGtmaW9fmLytsYyhmK6rlad6sbTYrKCcmZxis6qzx61ksp2coby4v9OopZ5lk6eyosDOq2StmamhvLN50qGcq6GUlrtw</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./cristiano-ronaldo-engagement-ring-georgina-rodriguez.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Is Cristiano Ronaldo engaged?
