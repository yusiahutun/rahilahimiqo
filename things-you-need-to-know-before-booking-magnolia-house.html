Specifically, the house is a 26 minute drive from <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.countryliving.com/life/travel/a41543/magnolia-farms-waco-tx/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Magnolia Market" class="body-link css-a3mbhf et3p2gv0">Magnolia Market</a> in downtown Waco, and a 33 minute drive from Waco Regional Airport. So if you're planning to fly in from out of town for your stay, you'll definitely want to book a rental car.</p><h2 data-node-id=8 class="article-sub-title css-1dtpnw8 et3p2gv0">2. If you want to secure a reservation, you need to act fast.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">As mentioned, when reservations open up for Magnolia House on <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://magnoliamarket.com/stay/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=MagnoliaMarket.com class="body-link css-a3mbhf et3p2gv0">MagnoliaMarket.com</a>, they go really, really quickly. I booked my stay, for spring 2017, when reservations opened last year on August 18th—and I was ready to go, right at 7 p.m., with my finger poised to click "book now." Luckily, I was easily able to nab the dates I wanted. But, just an hour later, reservations for the first six months of 2017 were gone. So, bookmark the <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://magnoliamarket.com/stay/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Magnolia website" class="body-link css-a3mbhf et3p2gv0">Magnolia website</a> right now (seriously, right now) if you want to grab a spot for 2018.</p><img alt="Lighting, Wood, Flowerpot, Plant, Property, Door, House, Hardwood, Light fixture, Ceiling, " title="Lighting, Wood, Flowerpot, Plant, Property, Door, House, Hardwood, Light fixture, Ceiling, " width=1126 height=1500 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/clv.h-cdn.co/assets/17/34/1503416733-img-1233.JPG?resize=640:*" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.countryliving.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p><span class="css-1lk26yx e6iqukd2">Lauren Matthews</span></p><img alt="Hardwood, Wood, Floor, Wood stain, Grass, Flooring, Soil, Wood flooring, Plant, Architecture, " title="Hardwood, Wood, Floor, Wood stain, Grass, Flooring, Soil, Wood flooring, Plant, Architecture, " width=1224 height=1632 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/clv.h-cdn.co/assets/17/34/1503415538-fullsizerender10.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.countryliving.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p><span class="css-1lk26yx e6iqukd2">Lauren Matthews</span></p><h2 data-node-id=12 class="article-sub-title css-1dtpnw8 et3p2gv0">3. Know the rules—and exactly which dates you want—before reservations open up.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">Since reservations go so fast, you'll want to know exactly which dates you're trying to secure when bookings open. Here are the rules: Check-in days are Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays only, and there is a two-night minimum on all reservations. Weeknights must be booked in two-night increments (two nights, four nights, six nights, and so on). Weekends can be booked in two or three night increments. You pay up front for the full stay, but here's the good news if you change your mind after booking your dates: Cancellations and changes to reservations can be made up to 21 days prior to the scheduled arrival date with a full refund. (After that, cancellations and changes are only eligible for a partial refund.) Oh, and following the initial deluge of bookings after reservations open, if there happen to be any one-night stays left behind, you can probably snag one—just email <a href=# class="css-a3mbhf et3p2gv0">stay@magnoliahomes.net</a> to see if they'll let you book one of those leftover single nights, since the online reservation system only allows for bookings of two nights or more. In my experience, the Magnolia customer service reps were quick to respond, eager to help, and super nice.</p><h2 data-node-id=14 class="article-sub-title css-1dtpnw8 et3p2gv0">4. The house is ideal for groups.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">Despite it being called a bed and breakfast, it's more of a vacation rental, in the sense that you can't book individual rooms—it has to be booked as a whole. So ideally, you're going to want to book Magnolia House with some kind of group, to help divide the cost. While I paid $695 a night for two weeknights (plus a 12 percent occupancy tax, so my total for two nights was $1,556.80), the cost can climb to as much as $995 a night depending on what days you book. Pricey if you're just a couple, but far more manageable if you're dividing the cost among several people.</p><img alt="Bedroom, Bed, Furniture, Room, Bed frame, Bed sheet, Interior design, Ceiling, Bedding, Canopy bed, " title="Bedroom, Bed, Furniture, Room, Bed frame, Bed sheet, Interior design, Ceiling, Bedding, Canopy bed, " width=1126 height=1500 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/clv.h-cdn.co/assets/17/34/1503416473-img-1228.JPG?resize=640:*" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.countryliving.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><span class="css-1lk26yx e6iqukd2">Lyndsey Matthews</span><p>The open room upstairs.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">If you are booking Magnolia House for a girls' getaway or a family vacation, you're probably curious about the sleeping arrangements. According to house rules, a maximum of eight people can stay in the house, and there are a total of six beds: Downstairs you'll find a room with a queen bed and a room with two twin beds; upstairs is an open space with a queen bed (heads up: there's no door on this "bedroom"!), plus two small rooms, each with a twin bed. Note: While all the rooms with the twin beds are ideal for kids, if you have little ones who are extra little, you'll want to bring a portable crib with you. Don't worry about feeling cramped with a full house, though: I stayed at Magnolia House with my husband and two-year-old son, along with my mom, my sister, and my aunt and uncle, and we all felt like we had enough space to spread out!</p><img alt="Product, Lighting, Room, Yellow, Bed, Interior design, Bedding, Linens, Floor, Bed frame, " title="Product, Lighting, Room, Yellow, Bed, Interior design, Bedding, Linens, Floor, Bed frame, " width=2250 height=3000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/clv.h-cdn.co/assets/17/34/1503439496-fullsizerender.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.countryliving.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><span class="css-1lk26yx e6iqukd2">Lyndsey Matthews</span><p>One of the upstairs rooms.</p><h2 data-node-id=19 class="article-sub-title css-1dtpnw8 et3p2gv0">5. The amenities are top-notch.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">Apart from said crib, there's really not much else you'd need to bring along with you to Magnolia House because Chip and Joanna have thought of everything. There's free WiFi, two coffee stations fully stocked with Keurig coffee machines, pods, creamer, sugar, and sweetener, all kinds of toiletries (read: fancy shampoo, conditioner, soap, etc.), bottled water, towels, bath robes, hair dryers, a washer and dryer, laundry detergent, a sewing kit, local guide books, umbrellas, charger cables, an iron, a TV and DVD player complete with a selection of family friendly flicks (think Gone with the Wind and Frozen), board games, a Bluetooth speaker, a full kitchen with every appliance, dish, pot, or pan you could possibly need to cook a four-course meal—seriously, I could go on and on, but you get the gist. They have it all! You'll even get a handful of 25% off coupon cards to use at Magnolia Market (score!).</p><img alt="Sleeve, Room, Floor, Textile, Outerwear, Flooring, Coat, Collar, Clothes hanger, Grey, " title="Sleeve, Room, Floor, Textile, Outerwear, Flooring, Coat, Collar, Clothes hanger, Grey, " width=2448 height=3264 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/clv.h-cdn.co/assets/17/34/1503439375-img-0984.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.countryliving.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p><span class="css-1lk26yx e6iqukd2">Lauren Matthews</span></p><img alt="Floor, Room, Tile, Flooring, Property, Building, Interior design, Furniture, Table, Ceiling, " title="Floor, Room, Tile, Flooring, Property, Building, Interior design, Furniture, Table, Ceiling, " width=2250 height=3000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/clv.h-cdn.co/assets/17/34/1503439785-fullsizerender2.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.countryliving.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><span class="css-1lk26yx e6iqukd2">Lauren Matthews</span><p>The upstairs coffee nook.</p><h2 data-node-id=23 class="article-sub-title css-1dtpnw8 et3p2gv0">6. The couple who runs Magnolia House is absolutely lovely.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=24 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">If you watched episode 18 of Fixer Upper's third season, you remember that Magnolia House is run by Rob and Marianne Ward on a day to day basis. The couple lives in a former carriage house (also renovated and designed by Chip and Joanna) directly behind the bed and breakfast property. You might also remember from the show that the Wards are as sweet as pie—a reputation they certainly lived up to in person, as well! After we settled in, Rob and Marianne came over to greet me and my family, show us the ropes, and tell us that if we needed anything just to let them know. (There is no daily meal service or housekeeping at Magnolia House, but the Wards are just a phone call or a text away if you need anything at all, like extra towels or more tiny bottles of shampoo). And if you ask nicely, they might even let you take a look inside their home, too!</p><img alt="People, Standing, Fun, Child, Vacation, Friendship, Jeans, Footwear, Family, Event, " title="People, Standing, Fun, Child, Vacation, Friendship, Jeans, Footwear, Family, Event, " width=3024 height=4032 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/clv.h-cdn.co/assets/17/34/1503446028-img-1309.JPG?resize=640:*" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.countryliving.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><span class="css-1lk26yx e6iqukd2">Lyndsey Matthews</span><p>Me and my family on the back porch of Magnolia House.</p><h2 data-node-id=26 class="article-sub-title css-1dtpnw8 et3p2gv0">7. If you ever wanted to know what it feels like to be a celebrity, this is your chance.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=27 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">There are tasteful black-and-white signs posted on the gates outside of Magnolia House that read: "For the privacy and security of our guests, please do not enter the property." At first I was a little freaked out by the constant stream of cars and pedestrians passing by the house to snap photos throughout the day, since it does make you feel a bit like you're living in a fishbowl. But, after getting used to it, it became fun to wave and smile at all the friendly Fixer Upper fans passing by. The town's City Manager agrees that the best tactic is to just embrace it all: "I live a block away and I can personally tell you that on Saturdays and Sundays, they drive by about one vehicle per minute to see the house, at the least," McGregor City Manager Kevin Evans told the <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://www.wacotrib.com/news/business/magnolia-house-books-up-on-first-day/article_6fa5fbf9-1d66-5f9c-b37f-3aea6165dcb3.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Waco Tribune-Herald" class="body-link css-a3mbhf et3p2gv0">Waco Tribune-Herald</a> in 2016. "During the daylight hours, that is absolutely true, and when I leave the house to go to work every day, whether that is 6:30 a.m. or 8:30 a.m., there is somebody outside taking pictures.

Joanna's signature style is on display throughout the home—the place is literally dripping in shiplap, open shelves, and white subway tile. And it's hard to walk around the space without remembering specific moments from the "<a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://www.hgtv.com/shows/fixer-upper/episodes/a-home-away-from-home-for-the-holidays data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="A Home Away from Home for the Holidays" class="body-link css-a3mbhf et3p2gv0">A Home Away from Home for the Holidays</a>" episode (don't worry—you won't get stuck in the house's tiny elevator like Chip did). Truly, the best part of staying at Magnolia House was just getting to kick back and soak it all in—it's an experience that is definitely worth it for any die-hard Fixer Upper fan. You'll feel like you're stuck inside a Pinterest board, in the best way possible. (If you want to get extra nerdy, like I did, tune into an episode of Fixer Upper on HGTV while sitting in the Magnolia House living room—so meta!) On my last evening at Chip and Joanna's bed and breakfast, as I perched in a rocking chair on the wraparound porch, glass of wine in hand and listening to the crickets chirp, I desperately didn't want my stay to end. You can bet I'll be back.</p><h6 class="css-5zz7ok e6pr2lz3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e6pr2lz1">Related Stories</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><span class="css-1s9owpq e19xk9rq1"><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/65968efa-eeae-4521-87d0-63ae6b282b96_1660753783.file?fill=1:1&resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Lauren Matthews" title="Headshot of Lauren Matthews" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Lauren (she/her) is the digital content director of the Hearst Lifestyle Group, where she oversees online content and strategy for Good Housekeeping, Woman's Day and other Hearst titles, including SEO, video, social media and e-commerce efforts.
