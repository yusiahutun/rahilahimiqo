He lost me,” Ariana said in an interview on the “Call Her Daddy” podcast in May 2023, two months after news broke of Tom and Raquel’s affair. “But I think that I trusted in him so much … that I trusted his perspective on things.” She continued, “I feel like we would have so many amazing times together, so then if there was a couple weeks that were not great or if I was, like, unsure about something [in the relationship], there was so much other stuff that was great. … It was almost, I think, hard to say, ‘Oh, this person’s not right for me,’ because I also had never been in a relationship that long before.”</p><p>When asked if she ever “turned a blind eye” in her relationship with Tom, Ariana admitted that she did. “But I think I was given a lot of assistance in doing that because I would bring things up and I would be shot down,” she said. “I was very much committed and I feel like I was doing my absolute best as a partner. But I don’t think I would do anything differently, just because I feel like all I can do is my best — and whether my best was good enough or not for anyone, that’s what it was.”</p><p>The two’s relationship was the source of drama in the season 10 reunion show and things between the cast members and time will tell if they’ll get everything figured out.</p><p>anderpump Rules is available to stream on <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=# data-type=link data-id="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/pmc_0aaa4_stylecaster?q=https%3A%2F%2Fimp.i305175.net%2Fc%2F256585%2F828265%2F11640%3FsubId1%3DSC-%26u%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.peacocktv.com%252F&p=https%3A%2F%2Fstylecaster.com%2Flists%2Fsomething-about-her-sandwich-shop-open%2F&ref=pmcTrackonomicsReferrer&event_type=click">Peacock</a>.
