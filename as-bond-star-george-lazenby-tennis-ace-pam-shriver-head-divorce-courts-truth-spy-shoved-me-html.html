'It is ludicrous for the petitioner to say that she is afraid of me.'</p><p>All in all, it's turning into a pretty explosive row - so explosive, in fact, that Lazenby claims Shriver has hidden away the guns they own at their Pacific Palisades home.</p><p>On Monday, their dispute will go before a judge at an LA court, where Shriver has filed for divorce on the grounds of irreconcilable differences.</p><p>But in the meantime, Lazenby and Shriver's war of words gives an astonishing insight into the domestic affairs of this incongruous couple.</p><p>Lazenby, more famously remembered as the muscular Bond who effortlessly swept Diana Rigg out of the crashing waves in the opening scenes of On Her Majesty's Secret Service, paints a rather amusing picture of himself as a house-husband - making weekly trips to the local supermarket, cooking all the family meals and tending to three-year-old George Jr and two-year-old twins Katie and Sammy, while career woman Shriver employs three nannies and spends up to two months of the year working away from home.</p><p>'I have changed hundreds of our children's nappies and could do it blindfolded,' says Lazenby.</p><p>All the while, Shriver insists her husband was violent and cites an incident where he admits bruising her during a row.</p><p>'The problem is that Pam is a competitive woman and George isn't going to take this lying down,' says a friend of the couple.</p><p>For many onlookers, the tensions in Mr and Mrs Lazenby's six-year marriage seemed obvious from the start. Aside from their 22-year age gap, no one would have matched the debonair heartthrob actor and the tennis champion who for years laughed off rumours that she was Martina Navratilova's 'partner' in more ways than one.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2008/08/23/article-1048480-02633CB500000578-60_468x602.jpg height=602 width=468 alt="George Lazenby as James Bond" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>007: George Lazenby played James Bond in 1969's On Her Majesty's Secret Service</p><p>But, in fact, when they met in the summer of 2000 in London, Lazenby and Shriver had much in common. They'd both lost loved ones to cancer. Shriver's first husband, Walt Disney lawyer Joe Shapiro, died from non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in 1999. Lazenby suffered heartache in 1994 when his 19-year-old son Zack died of brain cancer after a nine-year battle.</p><p>One of the couple's first dates was to see the Kate Winslet film Quills about the Marquis de Sade. During the most stomach-churning scenes, Shriver buried her head in Lazenby's shoulder and felt her initial reservations about their age gap melt away.</p><p>'I thought I should find someone within five years of my own age, but my history is older guys. I have a strong personality and older guys can deal with it better,' she said.</p><p>But if they thought they could soothe each other's heartache, it seems the pain that drew them together also began to sow the seeds for their break-up. When she met Lazenby, Shriver was 39 and desperate for children.</p><p>During her career she won 21 singles titles and 112 doubles titles, and in 1988 became a gold medallist at the Seoul Olympics with tennis doubles partner Zina Garrison.</p><p>She began dating Joe Shapiro in 1996 - the year she retired as a professional player - when he was in remission from non-Hodgkins lymphona. They married in 1998 and he died in 1999, leaving her a childless widow at 37.</p><p>'Pam was desperate for children when she met George,' says a family friend. 'And George was very understanding.'</p><p>At her very first meeting with Lazenby, Shriver made the astonishing admission that she might already be pregnant after undergoing IVF with her dead husband's sperm. It turned out she wasn't, but Lazenby took the possibility in his stride.<br></p><p>'He's so open-minded, it didn't put him off in the least,' she later recalled.<br></p><p>Meanwhile, Lazenby has had his own demons to battle. The son of a railway worker from the former Australian convict settlement, Goulburn, he came to London in 1963 - by boat because he couldn't afford the airfare.<br></p><p>He found work as a Mercedes car salesman on London's Park Lane, where photographer Chard Jenkins discovered him and lured him into modelling.<br></p><p>He gained fame in a TV advert as the Big Fry guy, carrying a packing case of Big Fry chocolate bars on his shoulders.<br></p><p>His chiselled good looks and physical fitness made him a perfect Bond once his Australian accent had been removed with elocution lessons. Becoming the second 007 after Sean Connery should have turned him into a multi-millionaire. In fact, On Her Majesty's Secret Service was an unmitigated disaster.<br></p><p>Lazenby rowed bitterly and publicly with co-star Diana Rigg and earned a reputation for being arrogant and awkward. According to producer Cubby Broccoli he was 'a pain in the neck'. The film, understandably, became a laughing stock.<br></p><p>Off screen, Lazenby became famed for the wild drink-fuelled parties he held at his flat in London's Eaton Square.<br></p><p>'I was socking the bottle like crazy,' he claimed in 1973, when his Bond career was already over. 'I had maybe two bottles of vodka a day. I'd saturate myself and pass out. It was to insulate me from the madness around Bond.'<br></p><p>In the aftermath of 007, Lazenby married U.S. newspaper heiress Christina Townson, and after several minor films moved into property investment. They had two children, Melanie, now 35, and Zack. But after Zack's death in 1994, their marriage collapsed.<br></p><p>Losing Zack, says Lazenby, was agonising. 'I thought the pain of seeing him die would break me.'<br></p><p>When Shriver and Lazenby met, they bonded over their similar losses. Shriver explained at the time: 'George is still so raw over the loss of his son. We're two people who were thrown together.' Two years after their marriage, George was born. Twins Katie and Sammie followed in 2005.<br></p><p>'It seemed like everything was going really well,' says the friend.<br></p><p>But documents seen by the Mail reveal the couple squabbled over the tiniest aspects of parenting: whether the children should wear sunblock, how many times a day they should brush their teeth, whether they should use car safety seats.<br></p><p>And, according to Shriver, rows caused by Lazenby's drinking had begun even before the pair married.<br></p><p>In her court declaration lodged by her lawyers a fortnight ago, she recalls that on New Year's Eve 2001 - six months before they wed - they attended a party in Australia at the house of Lazenby's sister, Barbara.<br></p><p>'Respondent had been drinking alcohol. Respondent became angry at his family and I observed Respondent yell at his family to the point that the tension was unbearable and we left the party early.'<br></p><p>Unsurprisingly, as the 'he saysshe says' battle gathered pace this week, Lazenby issued a volley of counter-claims.<br></p><p>One key night, the events of which are disputed by both sides, took place in October 2002 at restaurant Chez Mimi, near the couple's home in Brentwood, California. Lazenby and Shriver who were eating with two other couples, were informed by staff that Israeli government officials were dining in a private room and were being guarded by Israeli security forces.<br></p><p>According to Shriver: '[George] was drinking at dinner and became drunk and loud and verbal about his negative opinions on Israel. He began to state loudly, within hearing distance of the secret service men, that he believed the Israeli government were all "murderers".'<br></p><p>That's not how Lazenby remembers it. According to him: '[She] has painted me as this horrible anti-Semitic bigot to smear my name.'<br></p><p>Shriver recalls another occasion, in September 2005, when she was 30 weeks pregnant with the couple's twins and doing the dishes with her sister. Lazenby was telling a story and she claims he yelled at her when she and her sister shared a 'five-second exchange over what Tupperware to use for leftovers'.<br></p><p>The following day, she says, she went into premature labour, giving birth to twins weighing 2lb 11oz and 3lb. Lazenby says he is 'utterly horrified' by the suggestion that he was in some way to blame.<br></p><p>'I do not know what caused the Petitioner to go into pre-term labour, and I am certain neither does she.'<br></p><p>There are numerous other incidents, but the one which sparked the beginning of the end for the marriage took place on June 24, 2007, at Wimbledon, where the pair first met.<br></p><p>Returning home after watching the tournament, Lazenby and Shriver found their son Sammy crying in his cot and rowed over the behaviour of one of their three nannies.<br></p><p>According to Shriver: 'Respondent grabbed my arms and twice shook me hard, squeezing my arms until bruising both of them. It was the first and scariest physical incident.'<br></p><p>The following morning, Shriver fled with her three nannies and flew in a private plane to her mother's home in Baltimore, Maryland.<br></p><p>Lazenby admits leaving marks on his wife's arms - 'I felt horrible and told her so' - but says: 'This event was, in reality, a disagreement about our nanny not supervising our son.<br>'I heard our son screaming and I ran to him. I found that the nanny was in the shower, while our son was in the midst of a fit.'<br>He adds that his wife 'did not seem to be concerned. I grabbed her arms, to get her attention. I was upset at what I perceived to be a complete lack of concern for our son.'<br></p><p>He adds: 'I was probably more upset than I should have been due to the fact that I had been drinking at the time.'<br></p><p>In fact Lazenby's alcohol habit dominates Shriver's complaints.<br></p><p>'I expressed many times that until he got help I could no longer be in the marriage,' she says.<br></p><p>E-mails they exchanged at the time - which have been seen by the Mail - reveal the depths of their despair.<br></p><p>Lazenby wrote to his wife: 'I know in my heart that I don't want to hurt anyone. Yes, I get angry. I am strong enough to cut that out of my life and make it easy I will promise not to touch any kind of spirits ever again.'<br></p><p>Shriver responded: 'I know you are in pain, me too. I am in mourning, depressed - I am sorry it has come to this. I know you have a sensitive side, but it's the dark, aggressive, angry side that has been fuelled by booze that has resulted in this situation. I will always care for you. I am crying, too, Pam.'<br></p><p>In fact, although Shriver initiated divorce proceedings after the Wimbledon incident, she decided to give Lazenby a second chance after he promised to go into rehab.<br></p><p>The couple also underwent marriage counselling. 'We will both go to therapy,' she wrote to him. 'Obviously, you will remain sober. You will go to a grief seminar next weekend in Wyoming (I will pay for all this).'<br></p><p>When she suspected Lazenby was not keeping his side of the bargain, she told him: 'Your being sober is a non-negotiable aspect of us being together.' But within weeks the pair were squabbling again.<br></p><p>Lazenby wrote: 'I've been walking on eggshells in this relationship with your threats of divorce and rehab and I feel it is time for you to drop all this.'<br></p><p>According to his spokesman and close friend, Michael Sands, Lazenby attends Alcoholics Anonymous meetings. But Shriver has clearly had enough. Earlier this month, while he was in Australia visiting his mother, she again consulted her lawyers over his alleged behaviour.<br></p><p>When he flew back to LA a fortnight ago, a stunned Lazenby was served with divorce papers, a claim for sole custody of the couple's children, a temporary restraining order and an emergency protection order.<br></p><p>Lazenby, who is currently attending good parenting classes, is contesting the orders and applying for joint custody of his children.<br></p><p>He insists: 'Bad chemistry and disagreements about parenting do not fall within the definition of domestic violence.'<br></p><p>According to one of his friends: 'George is devastated. He can't believe what Pam is saying. She is airing phoney dirty laundry in public. He is a hands-on father and would never hurt his children. He was married for 24 years to his first wife Chrissie with no problems. He has never been arrested for domestic violence or drink-driving.<br></p><p>'After what happened to Zack, the thought of losing his children is the worst thing imaginable.'<br></p><p>Shriver's agent at the William Morris Agency in LA said she had no comment to make.</p><p>But one thing is certain. When it comes to tension and drama, the Lazenby-Shriver divorce battle looks set to rival the most gripping Wimbledon final or Bond movie.<br></p><p>Yet this isn't entertainment; it's real life - and the pain on both sides is genuine and deep.<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCmmZmhe6S7ja6iaKymqLWww8GisWiZoqm2pLjEZmhpbGhphXF7oKxke6eemXq0wMCrZICdn6e0pnmrmrGeppKuerWxzaegrGWRmLJunMCmZIygop7Dpr6MoZyanF2Ztre70ZycZpufqr%2B1v4ytqa6smGJ6tLzYZqqhp6aasW65xGefraWc</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./bianca-andreescu-and-pascal-siakam.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Bianca Andreescu and Pascal Siakam</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./where-to-watch-polar-express.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Where to Watch Polar Express Online Free: How to Stream</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./409878-100-summer-instagram-captions-sunny-funny-html.html>100+ summer Instagram captions that are sunny and funny</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-neck-cream.html>19 Best Neck Creams of 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./angelina-jolie-daughter-vivienne-resembles-brad-pitt-new-photo.html>Angelina Jolie's daughter Vivienne looks just like Brad Pitt in new photo from momentous outing toge</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chicagos-summer-smash-festival-signs-a-ticketing-deal-with-dice.html>Chicagos Summer Smash Festival Signs A Ticketing Deal With DICE</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./fosters-voice-reaching-his-peers-with-organization-of-school-club.html>Foster's Voice reaching his peers with organization of school club</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog.
