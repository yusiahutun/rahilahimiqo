It is not, however, usually associated with judges. But concerns have been raised in several parts of the common law world about judges lifting large amounts of text from lawyers’ submissions and using them in their judgments. This has, understandably, been widely recognised as a bad practice. Last week, a court judgment revealed that a Hong Kong judge, Mr Justice Wilson Chan Ka-shun, had copied verbatim more than 98 per cent of the plaintiff’s arguments in an intellectual property ruling he delivered in 2021. It is a serious case.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The judge, one of those approved by the chief executive to hear national security cases, has rightly been reprimanded by the chief justice who found his conduct to be “totally unacceptable”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">A core feature of the city’s common law system is the delivery of reasoned judgments. Judges are expected to apply their minds independently to the arguments put forward by the parties in a case. The wholesale adoption of one side’s submissions, with only cosmetic changes, amounted to an abdication of the judge’s judicial responsibility, the Court of Appeal said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The judge’s plagiarism has had serious consequences. An appeal against his decision was allowed on the grounds that it was unfair to the defendants, who argued that the judge did not engage with their lengthy submissions. A retrial was ordered, which will use valuable court time and bring additional costs and stress to the parties.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Hong Kong legal community urges more support for judges after chief justice criticism</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Judges necessarily include parts of the submission of lawyers in their judgments. But they are expected to grapple with the legal issues and provide their own reasoning. It is a concern that similar complaints have been made about Chan in the past.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Chief Justice Andrew Cheung Kui-nung has instructed the Judicial Institute to improve judges’ awareness of the copying issue. Such a step is clearly required. Guidance should be provided to ensure there is no room for doubt. The case should also focus attention on the need for judges to be given adequate support and to ensure their heavy workload is manageable, an issue highlighted by members of the legal profession. Judges have been under pressure, facing a backlog of cases due to the pandemic, criticism over rulings in politically sensitive cases and a manpower shortage. There are 164 judicial officers, but 47 vacancies. More must be done to fill the gaps, while ensuring that standards remain high.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">There is, however, no excuse for a judge lifting one side’s submissions for his ruling. As the chief justice said, copying of this kind undermines public confidence in the administration of justice. It must not happen again.</p><img aria-label=loading data-qa=BaseImage-handleRenderImage-StyledImage src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/assets-v2.i-scmp.com/production/_next/static/media/wheel-on-gray.af4a55f9.gif style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51ksLC5zJ6lrWefpbavtc6nZpqqpJ6wrbGObGlrbGRrfnC8y5qeopminsCuecmum6CdXaS7pnnCmqqeZaSkvG65wKewZqKlmbaktcCrsGatnpmys3nSrameq6M%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./flat-white-salted-caramel-baileys-recipe.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>This espresso-based cocktail is the sweet-treat all salted caramel lovers are going crazy for</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./little-miss-sunshine-abigail-breslin-plunging-wedding-dress-photos.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Little Miss Sunshine's Abigail Breslin's low-cut wedding dress has fans saying the same thing</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./409878-100-summer-instagram-captions-sunny-funny-html.html>100+ summer Instagram captions that are sunny and funny</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-neck-cream.html>19 Best Neck Creams of 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./angelina-jolie-daughter-vivienne-resembles-brad-pitt-new-photo.html>Angelina Jolie's daughter Vivienne looks just like Brad Pitt in new photo from momentous outing toge</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chicagos-summer-smash-festival-signs-a-ticketing-deal-with-dice.html>Chicagos Summer Smash Festival Signs A Ticketing Deal With DICE</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./fosters-voice-reaching-his-peers-with-organization-of-school-club.html>Foster's Voice reaching his peers with organization of school club</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog.
