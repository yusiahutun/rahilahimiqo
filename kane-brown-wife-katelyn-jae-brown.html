The pair were originally set to meet in 2015, back when Katelyn was pursuing her own singing career, reports <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://people.com/country/who-is-katelyn-jae-brown-kane-brown-wife/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=People class="body-link css-a3mbhf et3p2gv0">People</a>. Kane, then an up-and-comer himself, was supposed to appear in her video, but a conflict arose. <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://online.berklee.edu/takenote/katelyn-brown-talks-berklee-online-graduation-future-career-plans-and-life-at-home-with-kane-brown/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="The stars finally aligned" class="body-link css-a3mbhf et3p2gv0">The stars finally aligned</a> in 2016 at a Tampa, Florida, bar named the Dallas Bull where Kane was performing. Katelyn, who was living in Orlando, came to the show and they met.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">Before long she joined Kane on the road. As his country music career took off, Katelyn shifted her attention to the business side of the industry. She returned to school and completed her bachelor's degree through Berklee Online’s music business program. When everyone else on tour was sleeping late the day after a show, Katelyn was up early, coffee in hand, to "do homework for four or five hours, until people woke up," Katelyn shared in an <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://online.berklee.edu/takenote/katelyn-brown-talks-berklee-online-graduation-future-career-plans-and-life-at-home-with-kane-brown/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="interview with her alma mater." class="body-link css-a3mbhf et3p2gv0">interview with her alma mater.</a></p><h2 data-node-id=8 class="body-h2 css-1dtpnw8 et3p2gv0">Marriage, Kids, and the Family Biz</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">The couple wed in October 2018 and shared a first dance to "Best Part," a duet by H.E.R. and Daniel Caesar, Kane told the <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/11/arts/music/kane-brown-favorites.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="New York Times" class="body-link css-a3mbhf et3p2gv0">New York Times</a>.<br></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">Katelyn graduated in May 2019, displaying her diploma next to her husband's gold records. The pair talk about one day starting their own label, she told <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://online.berklee.edu/takenote/katelyn-brown-talks-berklee-online-graduation-future-career-plans-and-life-at-home-with-kane-brown/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Berklee Online" class="body-link css-a3mbhf et3p2gv0">Berklee Online</a>, and her music business insights have come in handy when her husband is making career decisions.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">Just a year after tying the knot, Kane and Katelyn welcomed their first daughter, Kingsley, in October 2019. Their second, Kodi, arrived in late December 2021, much to the surprise of fans who had no idea the couple was expecting.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">That leads us to another fact about this pair: They've learned all the tricks to keeping their private lives private. That might come as a surprise, as Kane has <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.instagram.com/kanebrown/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="3.4 million Instagram followers" class="body-link css-a3mbhf et3p2gv0">3.4 million Instagram followers</a>, Katelyn has <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.instagram.com/katelynbrown/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="1.5 million" class="body-link css-a3mbhf et3p2gv0">1.5 million</a>, and both accounts often share candid moments of their family life together.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">The couple had to learn how to set boundaries around their private life the hard way. In the past, eagle-eyed fans spotted Katelyn's ring before the couple's official engagement announcement, and the pair also missed the opportunity to share the news of their first pregnancy on their own terms, Kane told <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=520636762615660" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="The Bobby Jones Show" class="body-link css-a3mbhf et3p2gv0">The Bobby Jones Show</a>. So, when it came to baby two, they decided to keep it to themselves.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">Katelyn wore baggy clothes and stayed behind the stroller in public, while Kane would position himself in front of her belly when needed—and it worked. Scroll through the pair's Instagram posts, and you can spot their clever baby-disguising strategies at work, such as an oversized dressy white blazer buttoned over a white gown in a <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.instagram.com/p/CWHWTnQthNV/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=photo class="body-link css-a3mbhf et3p2gv0">photo</a> taken in November 2021. "I spy a Baby Bump now that I know!!" commented one fan in retrospect.</p><h2 data-node-id=19 class="body-h2 css-1dtpnw8 et3p2gv0">Life on the Road</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">Katelyn recently shared an <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.instagram.com/p/CqEUiTQMj-o/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Instagram tour" class="body-link css-a3mbhf et3p2gv0">Instagram tour</a> of the family's home away from home: their tour bus. Although the family doesn't always go on the road (in 2022, Kane gave Katelyn an <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.instagram.com/p/CZfE_dbPZ9A data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Instagram shoutout" class="body-link css-a3mbhf et3p2gv0">Instagram shoutout</a> for holding down the fort at home), they do go on tour together a lot, so they outfitted the bus with all the creature comforts, including framed family photos on the walls and kid-friendly features like a "baby bunk" for Kodi that functions as a crib, complete with safety netting to keep her from rolling out.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">To complement the bus's light and airy interior, they added touches of cedar for "that Nashville woodsy vibe" to remind them of home. There's even a farmhouse-style sink! “I wanted a farmhouse sink because Kodi’s still getting sink baths, at least while we’re on the road,” Katelyn said.</p><h2 data-node-id=23 class="body-h2 css-1dtpnw8 et3p2gv0">All About the Duo's No. 1 Hit, "Thank God"</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=24 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">Though Katelyn set aside aspirations for a solo career, “she’s always singing around the house and her voice is beautiful," Kane told <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.billboard.com/music/country/kane-brown-album-different-man-interview-1235136021/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Billboard class="body-link css-a3mbhf et3p2gv0">Billboard</a>. The couple had been looking for a song to record together for a while when they got the lyrics for "Thank God." The love song, written by Christian Davis, Kyle Fishman, Jaxson Free, Josh Hoge, and Jared Mullins, features a couple thanking God that they found each other: "Hand on the bible / Don't know how I got you / I couldn't ask for more" go the lyrics.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=26 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">Nominated for the 2023 CMT Video of the Year Award, the music video for "Thank God" was filmed in the lush tropical landscape of Hawaii, reports <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://countrynow.com/watch-kane-brown-beams-with-pride-as-wife-katelyn-joins-him-for-the-live-debut-of-their-duet-thank-god/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Country Now" class="body-link css-a3mbhf et3p2gv0">Country Now</a>. From the 2022 album Different Man, the duet was first performed for a live audience in December. The couple will perform the song at the 2023 CMT Awards, which airs on CBS April 2, 2023, at 8 p.m. ET/PT and streams on <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.paramountplus.com/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Paramount+ data-vars-ga-product-id=3ab5939e-eb0a-46c9-b1ab-4f0899af5cd2 data-vars-ga-link-treatment="sale | (not set)" data-href=https://www.paramountplus.com/ data-product-url=https://www.paramountplus.com/ data-affiliate=true data-affiliate-url="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=74968X1525072&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.paramountplus.com%2F" data-affiliate-network={} data-vars-ga-product-price=$1.99 data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id=ae11b9a7-11f8-42ea-9ddd-c166cf777911 data-vars-ga-product-sem3-category=Europe class="body-link product-links css-a3mbhf ebsw2pb0">Paramount+</a>.
