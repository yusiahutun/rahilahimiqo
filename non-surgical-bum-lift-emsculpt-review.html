You can thank (or blame) stars such as<strong> <a class=hm-link href=#>Kim Kardashian</a> </strong>and Nicki Minaj for making the peach emoji one of the most used icons on our social media accounts. Since 2014 when Kimmy stepped out on the cover of Paper Magazine, a champagne glass perched safely atop her rear it seemed to cement the status quo. We as a society have become bum obsessed.&nbsp;</p><p id=evO9E3vtjcR8 data-wc=1><strong>MORE: <a class=hm-link href=#>How to get a non-surgical eyelift: This new procedure is going to save you from going under the knife</a></strong></p><p id=epqmAM32CAsa data-wc=1><strong>RELATED: <a class=hm-link href=#>Jodie Comer used a £200 moisturiser to prepare for the gender neutral WhatsOnStage Awards</a></strong></p><strong class=fr-embedded><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/bb6a35736c74-bum1-z.jpg></strong> <strong></strong><p id=erduwlo9ZMDu data-wc=7><strong>Beauty standards have changed over the years</strong></p><p id=ev_AS-sGJ0fd data-wc=154>According to a <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>global survey</a> by the International Society of Aesthetic Plastic Surgery the number of surgical BBLs (Brazilian butt lifts) performed globally has grown by 77.6%. In fact it is the fastest-growing cosmetic surgery in the world. However there are many safety concerns and risks for the Brazilian butt lift. According to the NHS, “There have been a number of deaths following complications of the Brazilian butt lift (BBL) procedure,” they explain that “The risk of death for BBL surgery is at least 10 times higher than many other cosmetic procedures, and it has the highest death rate of all cosmetic procedures.” The main concern is that the injected fat can cause a blockage in a blood vessel in the lungs (pulmonary embolism), which can be fatal. In fact the <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons (BAAPS)</a> has advised its members not to carry out Brazilian butt lift surgeries until more is known about safer techniques of fat injection into the bottom.</p><p id=epFguNQlyWcF data-wc=36>Pretty scary, so what to do if your heart is set on a pert derrière?

They specialise in natural facial rejuvenations and <strong><a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>body contouring</a> </strong>procedures.&nbsp;</p><h2 dir=ltr><strong>What is a non-surgical Butt Lift?</strong></h2><p id=eiiZ-jiP6urR data-wc=128>A non-surgical Butt Lift uses a device called the<strong> <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>EMSculpt</a></strong>. It is a leading <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>non-surgical body sculpting</a> and FDA-cleared apparatus, which not only builds muscle but burns fat at the same time. Today’s non-invasive body shaping and contouring treatments can effectively reduce fat and tighten the skin, but more than a third of one’s body is comprised of muscles, so this device targets those areas specifically. The machine induces strong (supramaximal) muscle contractions not achievable through a regular workout. One 30-minute treatment is equivalent to 20,000 squats. After around six sessions you are said to notice a huge improvement.&nbsp;With no gym and minimal discomfort, it has gained a slew of celebrity fans and is rumoured to be beloved by Megan Fox, Drew Barrymore, Jennifer Lopez and even Kim Kardashian herself.&nbsp;</p><h2 dir=ltr><strong>What to expect during a non-surgical Butt Lift?</strong></h2><p id=efHxkMY9ceBD data-wc=113>During the treatment you are hooked up to the EMSculpt machine, with various metal pads pressed directly onto your target areas and these are kept in place with velcro straps. (They can also be used on the abdomen for those looking to work their abdominals.) Then the machine gets to work and during the treatment you can have water, and are able to watch TV or play with your phone to distract yourself, at the Cosmetic Skin Clinic there are TVs in the treatment room which is handy. Over the course of the session the therapist will increase the intensity of the machine, so that you are able to ease into the treatment.&nbsp;</p><h2 dir=ltr><strong>Does EMSculpt hurt?</strong></h2><p id=esM-4REdaHlG data-wc=47>It isn’t completely painless, which makes sense when you think about how hard your muscles are working during a session. The first session I found very intense but you get used to the feeling very quickly, I was able to catch up on emails during the sessions.&nbsp;</p><h2 dir=ltr><strong>What are the results of a non-surgical buttlift?&nbsp;</strong></h2><p id=eOsbAegtt2aA data-wc=78>Despite being pretty pain adverse, and asking for lower voltage repeatedly (with my very patient aesthetician Magda) it certainly got results after the six&nbsp;sessions I had. My PT asked me if I’d been working out independently and I actually felt a huge difference in my muscle tone. It’s not a huge difference (you’re not going to end up with the bum of a Kardashian if that’s what you're after) but everything is certainly more lifted, and sculpted.&nbsp;</p><p id=eVPftojCJGe7 data-wc=14><strong>Like this story?<a class=hm-link href=#>&nbsp;Sign up to our Hello!
