Both actresses had their hair scraped back from their faces and styled in plaits. Blake's version was beautifully boho-inspired with plenty of texture, and her plait featured quirky knotted shapes and a glittery ribbon woven through. She teamed it with a figure-hugging printed skirt and plunge-neck leather top, and accessorised with dramatic drop earrings and several chunky statement bangles.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/257cf21c71d0-blake-lively-hair-z.jpg><p id=eO1OM8_K_GrQ data-wc=9><strong>Blake went for a boho twist on the look</strong></p><p id=ea56t9TXIDhY data-wc=44>Emily, 35, went for a more classic version. Her hair was styled sleek and smooth, and her neat french plait started from near the crown and sat close to her head. She teamed it with a gorgeous pink prom-style Oscar de la Renta dress.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/37e1669ff2fc-emily-blunt-hair-z.jpg><p id=eeI6Jp78R3Vc data-wc=7><strong>Emily looked like a true English rose</strong></p><p id=exO-2D2GJGNP data-wc=38>The British actress is staring in the film alongside her husband, <a class=hm-link href=#>John Krasinski</a>, who also co-wrote and directed it.

"There's this awareness of what they're going to be exposed to and what they grow up seeing. For me, it's important for my daughters to know that it's not real life," she said. "They're seeing me dressed up in all this hair and makeup, but they also see me without that. I want them to see both sides, because there is never just one side."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfnbKiuNOhmKeckpqutsDYaJ%2BaoaJkf3F9l2lraWtkbIF4fI6epKKkqWKvrcHNrWSbpJGgsm64yK%2BcpbFdna6qvtKtsKWdo2Q%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./kim-kardashian-cfda-outfit-rick-owens.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Kim Kardashian Basically Recreated an Outfit from Three Years Ago for the CFDA Awards</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./feel-good-movies-for-women-on-netflix.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>9 Best Feel Good Movies for Women on Netflix, Ranked</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./409878-100-summer-instagram-captions-sunny-funny-html.html>100+ summer Instagram captions that are sunny and funny</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-neck-cream.html>19 Best Neck Creams of 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./angelina-jolie-daughter-vivienne-resembles-brad-pitt-new-photo.html>Angelina Jolie's daughter Vivienne looks just like Brad Pitt in new photo from momentous outing toge</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chicagos-summer-smash-festival-signs-a-ticketing-deal-with-dice.html>Chicagos Summer Smash Festival Signs A Ticketing Deal With DICE</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./fosters-voice-reaching-his-peers-with-organization-of-school-club.html>Foster's Voice reaching his peers with organization of school club</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog.
