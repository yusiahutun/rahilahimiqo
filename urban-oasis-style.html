One prime example is D’Rapport Residences, which is especially ideal for those looking for a second home or buy-to-let property in the friendly tropical country.&nbsp;</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“From our experience in serving Hong Kong homebuyers, they are concerned about public infrastructure connectivity, convenience of daily living, whether there are international schools, clinics and hospitals nearby, and how long it takes to walk to the nearest shopping mall and restaurants. Unlike local Malaysians, because the majority of Hong Kong buyers are buying as a second home away from Hong Kong as their future retirement home, they want every imaginable convenience at doorstep,” said Nathan Yeng, sales manager for the developer Perspektif Masa Sdn Bhd, a subsidiary of ACMAR Group.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/660w/public/d8/images/2019/10/14/drapport_entrance_lowres.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-1 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">An expat-friendly haven</strong><br>Immersed in natural beauty, D’Rapport Residences is quietly tucked away on a verdant plot of land in the residential enclave of Ampang, which is very close to the heart of Kuala Lumpur, literally just 3 km from KLCC and 8 km from the KL Sentral station. Located in the city’s embassy district, Ampang is a safe and secure neighbourhood and is home to a large community of ambassadors, international trade delegates and expat families, who work at the embassies and multinational companies in and around the city centre. &nbsp;</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The affluence of this established community has prompted the provision of international retail, healthcare and education facilities, with a choice of groceries, private hospitals and international schools. For example, popular supermarkets such as Cold Storage, Ben’s Independent Grocer, Village Grocer and Jaya Grocer are located within 2 km radius of D’Rapport Residences. Kuala Lumpur International School and a wide selection of clinics and healthcare service providers, including Gleneagles Hospital and Prince Court Medical Centre, are all nearby.&nbsp;</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">After all, the country’s slower pace of life, abundance of natural outdoor space, cultural and language similarities, a high quality of life and comparatively more reasonable home prices are among the prime reasons attracting Hongkongers to reside or retire in Malaysia through the increasingly popular MM2H visa programme. Yeng added that they would provide complimentary MM2H visa application for D’Rapport Residences buyer’s application with hassle-free and other interesting packages.&nbsp;</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">Master-planned community with resort-style facilities</strong><br>Spread across 9.12 acres of land, D’Rapport Residences is a thoughtfully planned community in a low-density setting designed to allow residents a relaxing, resort-like and convenient lifestyle. The 1,099 homes are spread over five towers, each standing at 38 storeys. Each floor has six “detached villa” units while each tower is served by five plus one high-speed lifts, so that residents enjoy a higher level of privacy and convenience.&nbsp;</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Truly rare for a city-centre residential development, D’Rapport Residences is a place embraced by over 50 different types of sports, recreational and entertainment facilities spread over 288,000 square feet of indoor and outdoor spaces.&nbsp;</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">On the podium, there is a 76m-long swimming pool and lap pools, dipping pools and jacuzzies, two tennis courts, a basketball court, children’s playgrounds, just to name a few, not to mention the beautiful landscaping, lush gardens with gazebo and shady trees all over the complex; this is a plot of city living that is, at the same time, resort and residence, holiday home and private oasis.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/660w/public/d8/images/2019/10/14/drapport_pool_10_lowres.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The Sky Garden atop The Winston (Tower E) provides a protruding glass encased sky bar, two sky pools and BBQ areas, which are perfect for neighbours to get together while overlooking the city’s skyline.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">D’Rapport Residences brings not only the privilege of extensive outdoor living but also a luxury lifestyle similar to when you are inside a five-star hotel or a prestigious club. Residents will enjoy a wide array of exquisite indoor amenities including golf driving ranges, putting greens, golf simulators, café, alongside a state-of-the-art gymnasium with sauna.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/660w/public/d8/images/2019/10/14/drapport_park_top_lowres.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The retail podium will consist of new, exciting retail shops, groceries, restaurants, childcare service centres, and family-oriented entertainment options. With as many as 45 shops downstairs to meet your daily needs along with a wide range of indoor and outdoor facilities, D’Rapport Residences presents the perfect blend of convenience, contemporary lifestyle and refined domestic tranquillity.&nbsp;</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">It is this holistic approach to overall planning and landscape design that has won D’Rapport Residences multiple awards, including Best Family Friendly Development and Best Resort Home Development in Japan International Property Awards. ASEAN Mater Class Award in City Lifestyle Development Excellence in ASEAN Outstanding Business Awards; Best Partner Award in ETOUCE Top Elites of Industry Awards; The Best Urban Condo Development in Des Prix Infinitus ASEAN Property Awards.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">Strategic location underpins real estate value</strong><br>Ampang is a well-established district of Kuala Lumpur. As such, available prime sites for future development is scarce. Also, due to the high concentration of embassies in the vicinity, the city planning code is restrictive when it comes to building density. This means that there will not be many high-rise buildings in the foreseeable future and that housing supply will be limited.&nbsp;</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Another advantage lies in its strategic location that has great connectivity to Bandar Malaysia, where a multi-billion Ringgit development scheme is now underway. Government agencies are now partnering with developers to build a massive 486-acre mixed-use development, which will include a transport hub that connects the area to the long-awaited high-speed railway to Singapore. For Hongkongers to understand its significance, let’s compare it to the Hong Kong West Kowloon Station.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/660w/public/d8/images/2019/10/14/drapport_skybar_exterior_lowres.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">Excellent connectivity&nbsp;</strong><br>D’Rapport Residences is also strategically located with direct and easy access to highways that lead all the way to major satellite towns neighbouring Kuala Lumpur. For example, the entry onto Ampang Kuala Lumpur Elevated Highway (AKLEH) that connects to KLCC’s carpark in five minutes is just 500 metres away from the entrance lobby. Meanwhile, MRR2 and DUKE highways are just about eight minutes’ drive away. Light-rail transport and bus stops are also close by.&nbsp;</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Down the line, owners will benefit from substantially improved vehicular accessibility when upgrading works on Jalan Ampang are completed, not forgetting, DUKE 3 highway made available to access, international elite and expat shall able to reach TRX International Finance District & Bandar Malaysia in next 1 and 2 interchanges within minutes.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kvbOx0p6lrZ2UZL2zu8%2Beqa2xX6m8sbXCrGauqpKWu267wKygrGWjqcatsY6aqa2hk6GycH%2BPbGlxbWhkwrOuwKdkqJmjnsBuv9Oyo54%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./dominic-roque-and-bea-alonzo.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Dominic Roque and Bea Alonzo</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./britney-spears-2007-vmas-performance-not-having-six-pack-abs-was-offensive-8379382.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>&amp;quot;Everyone Was Acting Like My Not Having Six-Pack Abs Was Offensive</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./409878-100-summer-instagram-captions-sunny-funny-html.html>100+ summer Instagram captions that are sunny and funny</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-neck-cream.html>19 Best Neck Creams of 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./angelina-jolie-daughter-vivienne-resembles-brad-pitt-new-photo.html>Angelina Jolie's daughter Vivienne looks just like Brad Pitt in new photo from momentous outing toge</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chicagos-summer-smash-festival-signs-a-ticketing-deal-with-dice.html>Chicagos Summer Smash Festival Signs A Ticketing Deal With DICE</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./fosters-voice-reaching-his-peers-with-organization-of-school-club.html>Foster's Voice reaching his peers with organization of school club</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog.
