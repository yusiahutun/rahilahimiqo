Kandi Burruss, Tiny Harris, LaTocha Scott, and Tamika Scott each brought something different to the platinum-selling group, while they’ve all faced varying levels of scrutiny throughout their careers.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Xscape-red-carpet.jpg><h2 id=h-xscape-was-one-of-the-90s-biggest-r-b-groups>Xscape was one of the ’90s’ biggest R&B groups</h2><p id=par-2_40>Xscape was one of many R&B girl groups to emerge in the early 1990s, such as SWV and En Vogue. They were discovered and first promote by Jermaine Dupri, who signed him to his So So Def record label.</p><p id=par-3_60>They released their debut album Hummin’ Comin’ at ‘Cha in 1993. It was certified platinum and sold over 1 million copies in the first year and included the top 10 singles “Just Kickin’ It” and “Understanding.” Their second and third albums reached even higher heights, with many of the singles making a splash on the Billboard Hot 100 chart.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/LaTocha-Scott.jpg><h2 id=h-latocha-scott-was-ridiculed-for-her-weight>LaTocha Scott was ridiculed for her weight</h2><p id=par-4_39>As the eldest member of the group, LaTocha Scott was often regarded as the de facto lead singer of the group. As a result, she was often under a microscope and many were quick to criticize her size.</p><p id=par-5_21>Scott opened up about her weight criticism and being considered “the big girl” in a 2020 interview with <a href=#>Claudia Jordan</a>.</p><p id=par-6_43>“It’s hurtful. Very hurtful,” she said honestly. “I came home a lot of nights crying. And that’s another reason my husband and I are as close as we are — because he gave me that shoulder and he gave me the real.”</p><p id=par-7_24>“Every day we set goals,” she continued. “So he was very instrumental in me getting to LaTocha but it was very hurtful early on.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Xscape-performing.jpg><h2 id=h-latocha-scott-had-to-convince-tiny-harris-about-vegan-food>LaTocha Scott had to convince Tiny Harris about vegan food</h2><p id=par-8_61>Today, Scott is a proud vegan and often cooks vegan food for friends who come to her house. “Any time my husband would invite someone over, I would just make the vegan dishes and they would have no idea. And then when they found out it was vegan, they were like, ‘Oh my God, Tocha, you got something,’” she recalled.</p><p id=par-9_58>She then revealed that she had to work hard to convince one of her Xscape groupmates that vegan food can taste good. “The hardest person for me to win over was Tiny,” she said. “This girl is so freaking picky. She said, ‘I don’t believe you. Come over to the house and let me see what you got.’”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGTFtK%2FAqZxmpJGpvKS0wGaqnKekqXq3scaapWaapaG5urXNoGWhrJ2hfA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./ariana-grande-and-ethan-slater-take-next-big-step-in-blossoming-relationship.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Ariana Grande and Ethan Slater 'take next big step' in blossoming relationship</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./angelina-graovac-tennis-onlyfans-model-28957928.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Stunning Australian tennis star turned to OnlyFans to fund her Grand Slam dream</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./409878-100-summer-instagram-captions-sunny-funny-html.html>100+ summer Instagram captions that are sunny and funny</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-neck-cream.html>19 Best Neck Creams of 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./angelina-jolie-daughter-vivienne-resembles-brad-pitt-new-photo.html>Angelina Jolie's daughter Vivienne looks just like Brad Pitt in new photo from momentous outing toge</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chicagos-summer-smash-festival-signs-a-ticketing-deal-with-dice.html>Chicagos Summer Smash Festival Signs A Ticketing Deal With DICE</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./fosters-voice-reaching-his-peers-with-organization-of-school-club.html>Foster's Voice reaching his peers with organization of school club</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog.
