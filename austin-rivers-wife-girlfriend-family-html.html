However, Austin is on his path to making a legacy in the NBA, different from his father's. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-606 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p style=text-align:justify>Austin is a guard for the Houston Rockets and has been playing for the team&nbsp;since 2018.</p><p style=text-align:justify>A tattoo enthusiast, son of an NBA legend, and a great player - there is a lot of exciting stuff to know about Austin.</p><h2 style=text-align:justify>Does Austin Have A Wife? About&nbsp;Relationships</h2><p style=text-align:justify>While his fans would love to see Austin walk down the aisle, they might be disappointed to know the athlete is not a married man. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-607 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p style=text-align:justify>However, he does have a girlfriend-fiancee named Brittany Hotard, who is no less than a wife to him.</p><p style=text-align:justify>Austin and Brittany started as best friends. But, they chose to take their relationship to the next level&nbsp;sometime around June&nbsp;2012. Meanwhile, the athlete also publicly acknowledged his love for Brittany via Instagram. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-608 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p style=text-align:justify></p><p style=text-align:justify><strong>Austin Rivers and Brittany Hotard in June 2016</strong> (Photo: Austin Rivers's Instagram)</p><p style=text-align:justify>The&nbsp;relationship took off instantly, and the lovers&nbsp;are still together. They even have a child together. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-609 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p style=text-align:justify>The couple's&nbsp;son, Kayden James Rivers, was born on 28th August 2018.</p><p style=text-align:justify>But, no relationship is free from troubles. And, neither was Austin and Brittany's time together free from chaos.&nbsp;Just after one year of&nbsp;their son's birth, Austin was caught cheating on his partner. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-611 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p style=text-align:justify>There have been no reports of them separating over this incident. However, the&nbsp;cheating evidence had surfaced in June 2019, right before the wedding date that the pair&nbsp;set for 19th July 2019. So, Austin's adultery&nbsp;could have led to the couple postponing their&nbsp;marriage to a further date.</p><h2 style=text-align:justify>Family And Background</h2><p style=text-align:justify>Austin comes from a family with a sports background. His father, <a href=# rel=follow>Glenn "Doc" Rivers</a> is a former basketball player who played for the Atlanta Hawks during his&nbsp;days as an athlete. After his career as a player ended, Doc transitioned to coaching and has coached Austin during his stint with the&nbsp;LA Clippers.</p><p style=text-align:justify>On the other hand, Austin's mother&nbsp;is Kristen Rivers. Doc and Kristen tied the knot back in 1986. They have four children together. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p style=text-align:justify><strong>You May Also Like:-&nbsp;</strong><a href=# title="Tyus Battle NBA Draft, Career, Injury, Parents" rel=follow>Tyus Battle NBA Draft, Career, Injury, Parents</a></p><p style=text-align:justify>Austin is the third of four siblings, who are all involved in&nbsp;sports.

His younger brother is Spencer, who also plays basketball at UC Irvine.</p><p style=text-align:justify>Sadly, Austin doesn't have a healthy relationship with all his family members. It is known that Austin does not have a great link with his father. The Rockets player revealed in a post-game press conference in 2016 that he and his father Doc are not close to each other. The father-son duo knows each other strictly in terms of basketball.</p><h2 style=text-align:justify>Wiki-Bio Of Austin Rivers</h2><p style=text-align:justify>Austin Rivers (full name - Austin James Rivers) is 24 years of age, according to his birth date on&nbsp;27th June 1995.
