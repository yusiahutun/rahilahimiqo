Traditionally, monarchs have stayed on the throne until health or other reasons, much like the late <a href=#>Queen Elizabeth II</a>. Her father, King George, also served as head of state until he sadly died.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/11/GettyImages-1243072898-1024x711.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-king-charles-has-planned-to-abdicate>King Charles has ‘planned’ to abdicate</h2><p>Irving told the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Express US</a> he believes King Charles will step down within the next five years. By that time, he will be 80 years old. This means that <a href=#>Prince William</a> can then become the head of The Firm.</p><p>“It may have already been surreptitiously planned that the King will abdicate when he’s 80,” he said.</p><p>He continued saying the King may stay on the throne to see the royal family through a “difficult transitional phase” after his youngest son, <a href=#>Prince Harry</a>, stepped down from his role. He made this decision alongside his wife <a href=#>Meghan Markle</a> in 2020.</p><p><strong>MORE:</strong> <a href=#>Meghan Markle’s unexpected characteristic is being ‘adopted by Kate Middleton’</a></p><p>“He [Charles] wants to just have his moment in the limelight for a few years,” Irving explained. “Make sure that William and Harry are carried through what’s going to be an incredibly difficult transitional phase for the monarchy.’</p><p>He then believes that <a href=#>Queen Consort Camila</a> will join her husband at Balmoral to enjoy retirement after King Charles abdicates. Meanwhile, William, now 41, and his wife <a href=#>Kate Middleton</a> take the reigns as King and Queen.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-how-long-is-king-charles-on-the-throne>How long is King Charles on the throne?</h2><p>King Charles became the monarch after the death of his mother <a href=#>Queen Elizabeth</a> in September last year. However, his coronation didn’t take place until May this year.</p><p>Typically, a monarch is on the throne until their death, as was the late Queen, but sometimes the king or queen will step down (also known as abdicating) and let the person next in line take over. In the current line of succession, this would mean William and Kate would become King and Queen of the UK.</p><p>In his first speech as King, Charles said: “In that faith, and the values it inspires, I have been brought up to cherish a sense of duty to others, and to hold in the greatest respect the precious traditions, freedoms and responsibilities of our unique history and our system of parliamentary government.</p><p>“As The Queen herself did with such unswerving devotion, I too now solemnly pledge myself, throughout the remaining time God grants me, to uphold the Constitutional principles at the heart of our nation.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-when-does-william-become-king>When does William become king?</h2><p>William will assume the role of king after his dad either abdicates to retire (or for other reasons such as ill health) or dies.</p><p>Talking about his future, the <a href=#>royal</a> said early last year that it “wasn’t at the top” of his priorities.</p><p>He explained: “I certainly don’t lie awake at night waiting or hoping for it because it sadly means my family has moved on, and I don’t want that.”</p><p><strong>MORE:</strong> <a href=#>Prince Harry’s adorable gesture towards Meghan Markle as they enjoy date night</a></p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFsZmppX2eFcLfIp55mm5iWv62x0makmrFdobKiwsRmq6GdXam1s7vNnmSemaKhtqa%2BjK2mZqWRoLJuw8CyZJ%2BnomK9s7XNnJxmr5mhuaqtzGaYrqyYpL9uv8Cyqmg%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./raf-simons-designer-calvin-klein.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Raf Simons's 50 Best Dior Runway Looks and Red-Carpet Gowns</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./jenna-jameson-marries-jessi-lawless.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Jenna Jameson Marries Jessi Lawless In Las Vegas Ceremony</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./409878-100-summer-instagram-captions-sunny-funny-html.html>100+ summer Instagram captions that are sunny and funny</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-neck-cream.html>19 Best Neck Creams of 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./angelina-jolie-daughter-vivienne-resembles-brad-pitt-new-photo.html>Angelina Jolie's daughter Vivienne looks just like Brad Pitt in new photo from momentous outing toge</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chicagos-summer-smash-festival-signs-a-ticketing-deal-with-dice.html>Chicagos Summer Smash Festival Signs A Ticketing Deal With DICE</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./fosters-voice-reaching-his-peers-with-organization-of-school-club.html>Foster's Voice reaching his peers with organization of school club</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog.
