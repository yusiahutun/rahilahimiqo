The sets were being built, shooting was about to begin, and Pitt dropped out. The entire production was scrapped, but Aronofsky couldn't let go. With a revamped script and pared-down budget, The Fountain found a new lead: Hugh Jackman. <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>According to Weisz</a>, it was Jackman's idea that she take on the role originally meant for Blanchett.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_31-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"We just drew a line there," Weisz told <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>The Telegraph</a> of her and Aronofsky's previous stance on working together. "You have your real life and then you have your work."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_33-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Still adhering to that logic, Aronofsky and Weisz made an unorthodox decision: they'd live apart while filming.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_35-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"We made a decision before we started that if we were going to do it we had to have good boundaries," Weisz told <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>The Independent</a> — one of said "boundaries" manifesting in her <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>moving out of their shared N.Y.C. apartment</a> for three months.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_37-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Steve Finn/Getty Images</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_38-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Weisz told <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>The Daily Telegraph</a> that Aronofsky "was so busy when he was at work, he only had time to be the director," adding, "He didn't have time to be my boyfriend."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_40-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Despite any previous misgivings, both parties acknowledged that working together was fine — beneficial, even.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_44-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"We had an intimacy that we were able to translate into work as well," Aronofsky told <a href=# class="CMY_Link CMY_Valid" data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>The Guardian</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_46-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"There are success stories and people who end up splitting up," Weisz explained in the same interview, "but we did OK."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_48-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In fact, things were so professional on set that it got … weird?</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_50-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In an interview with BlackBook Magazine, Jackman reminisced about shooting a steamy scene between him and Weisz.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_52-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Toni Anne Barson Archive/WireImage</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_53-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"There was a scene that called for me falling into the bath with Rachel.

While the couple had known each other long before they got together, Weisz insisted things had remained strictly friendly between them while she was with Aronofsky. "It wasn't really like that," <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>she reportedly said</a> when asked if it had been love at first sight, "We'd been friends for ages."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_69-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Like Weisz, Aronofsky has dodged questions about his ex in interviews since the split.
