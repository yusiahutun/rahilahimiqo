He undertook missions in Australia, the UK, and the US. He also served some time in Afghanistan.

The awards are going into its 21st year and will be hosted by <a href=#>Hollywood</a> legend John Travolta.</p><p>Harry will be honored alongside three others who have also served in the Army. They are Fred George, a Navy pilot and world-renowned writer, former world speed record holder and film pilot Steve Hinton, and CEO of flight training company CAE Inc. Marc Parent.</p><p>This isn’t the first award the 39-year-old has received for his service, as he has previously received his Flying Wings.</p><p>Despite no longer serving, the Duke of Sussex has continued to champion those who have, and continue to, serve. He created The Invictus Games, an international, multi-sport tournament. It sees service people (both past and present) who are wounded, injured, and sick take part. He made a documentary about the games for <a href=#>Netflix</a>.

He explained his belief that “context was important.” He said he wished for conversations about the mental <a href=#>health</a> and PTSD of those who serve once they return home.</p><p>“I think the most important thing here is, not only the context, but the reason why I decided to share this in my book,” he <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">said</a>. “To the vets here and to the civilians here — which this may feel as though this is slightly a weird conversation to have, especially on this show of all show.</p><p>“I made a choice to share it, because having spent nearly two decades working with veterans all around the world, I think the most important thing is to be honest and to be able to give space to others to be able to share their experiences without any shame.”</p><p><strong>MORE:</strong> <a href=#>Prince Harry’s latest win is ‘about time’ and will ‘fuel’ his fight for the future</a></p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFtZmlpX2Z%2FcLzRoqWcnV2drrO%2B2GarqGWimrCmtdWeZKmqlajBqrPIqKysZZGrtqLAyKilZpmnlr%2BlecWoqWagmah6tbXMnmSipl2ptaZ5zKKjoqyRp8Zw</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./garth-brooks-net-worth.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>ACM Salary, How Much He Makes Per Concert</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./lainey-wilson-father-cma-awards-red-carpet.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Here's Why Lainey Wilson's Father Was Her CMA Awards Date</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./409878-100-summer-instagram-captions-sunny-funny-html.html>100+ summer Instagram captions that are sunny and funny</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-neck-cream.html>19 Best Neck Creams of 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./angelina-jolie-daughter-vivienne-resembles-brad-pitt-new-photo.html>Angelina Jolie's daughter Vivienne looks just like Brad Pitt in new photo from momentous outing toge</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chicagos-summer-smash-festival-signs-a-ticketing-deal-with-dice.html>Chicagos Summer Smash Festival Signs A Ticketing Deal With DICE</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./fosters-voice-reaching-his-peers-with-organization-of-school-club.html>Foster's Voice reaching his peers with organization of school club</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog.
