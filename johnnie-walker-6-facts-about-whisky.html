On the west side of the island, the farm was not far from Glasgow. John’s father died in 1819, and the family farm, where Johnnie had spent his first fourteen years, was sold. Even though he was only 15 years old at the time, the funds from the sale were utilized to buy a grocery store in Kilmarnock. After a brief period of learning his new trade, John assumed full control of his booming company.</p><p>Despite the fact that his main business was selling groceries, he became regarded as the go-to source for tea, premium wines, and spirits over time. He offered a variety of alcoholic beverages, such as rum, brandy, and gin, but it was his own private label whiskey that made him famous in the area. Single malts were carried by the majority of shop owners at the time, and their flavor and texture were uneven. Mr. Walker, being a shrewd businessman, blended his whiskey, allowing him to retain consistent flavour quality in each bottle.</p><p>Of course, the corporation has continued to expand, with the addition of Johnnie Walker’s Blue, Double Black, Gold, and Platinum labels. The whiskey is no longer distilled in Kilmarnock, and the old factory has been dismantled as part of a huge worldwide company’s portfolio of brands. The robust, Scottish spirit of the original Johnnie Walker can still be found in every drink, even if the facilities are no longer available.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Johnnie Walker’s 200-Year History</h2><p>The new Johnnie Walker experience, which is part of a £185 million Diageo <a href=#>investment</a> in Scotch whisky tourism, will take tourists through Johnnie Walker’s 200-year history and take them on a trip through Scotland’s flavours. Visitors will be able to enjoy breath-taking views of Edinburgh Castle and the city skyline from rooftop bars.</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener>Johnnie Walker</a> recently announced the arrival of four new limited editions Johnnie Walkers on retailers throughout the world. Each limited-edition release, which includes a new bottle design and three newly created whiskies, is a celebration of John’s extraordinary journey, pioneering spirit, and commitment to excellence that began in those early days.</p><p>The legendary Johnnie Walker Red Label, Johnnie Walker Black Label, and Johnnie Walker Gold Label Reserve whiskies have also received three new limited-edition bottles. Each is a vibrant and eye-catching reinterpretation of the original Johnnie Walker square bottle, appropriate for the 200th Anniversary.</p><p>The Discovery Channel will run a feature documentary made by Oscar-nominated director Anthony Wonke next month that examines how Johnnie Walker came to be regarded as a cultural icon. And Canongate Books has just released A Long Stride by Nicholas Morgan, a book that tells the incredible story of how Johnnie Walker became the world’s most popular Scotch.</p><p>Here are some of the key milestones of the company:</p><figure class=wp-block-table><table><tbody readability=31.5><tr><td><strong>Year</strong></td><td><strong>Milestones</strong></td></tr><tr readability=2><td>1820</td><td>Opening of the John Walker’s grocery shop.</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>1857</td><td>John’s son Alexander takes over the business following John’s death and transforms the company.</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>The 1860s</td><td>Creation of the first commercial blend ‘Old Highland Whisky’ and introduction of the slanted labels.</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>The 1870s</td><td>First to produce whisky in square bottles instead of regular round bottles.</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>1906</td><td>Started production of White, Red, and Black Label variants.</td></tr><tr readability=5><td>1908</td><td>A renowned cartoonist Tom Browne drew the ‘Striding Man’ figure, and the business formally adopts the name, Johnnie Walker.</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>1920</td><td>Availability of Johnnie Walker in over 120 countries.</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>1934</td><td>Supplied whisky to the royal household: John Walker & Sons granted a Royal Warrant by King George V.</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>1945 to 1955</td><td>Upsurge in the exports 115 percent to just over 1 million cases.</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>1982</td><td>The appearance of Johnnie Walker in the original Blade Runner movie.</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>1992</td><td>Launched Johnnie Walker Blue Label— an exquisite combination of Scotland’s rarest and most exceptional whiskies.</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>1999</td><td>Launched the first-ever Johnnie Walker global advertising campaign ‘Keep Walking’.</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>1999-2007</td><td>Regular appearances of the Johnnie Walker bottles in The Sopranos, including an episode in which Salvatore Bonpensiero gives a bottle of Johnnie Walker Gold Label as a gift.</td></tr><tr readability=6><td>2005</td><td>Launched Johnnie Walker Green Label— crafted from a palette of Speyside, Highland, Lowland, and Island malts matured for at least 15 years.</td></tr><tr readability=4><td><strong>2007</strong></td><td>Launched Johnnie Walker Gold Label Reserve.
