Taking to Instagram, the 49-year-old wrote: "Farewell Bake Off! It's been a delicious experience and I can't imagine a more fun way of spending my summers. But it's become clear to me that I can't present both Fantasy Football League and Bake Off alongside all my other projects.

We just thought it was time, so we quit our jobs and decided to do that," he said.&nbsp;</p><p id=eRNEiPaqgwu data-wc=51>"It will be a show with us playing lots of characters," added Matt.

With the Little Britain stars spending a lot of time together recently, we wouldn't be surprised if they made an announcement about their next collaboration in the coming months.
