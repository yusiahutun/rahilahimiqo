I think it was a two-hour standoff about a note he had about whether I could wear mascara or not wear mascara," the 30-year-old daughter of Penn and ex-wife <a href=#>Robin Wright</a> shared.</p><p>"That's a fight a father usually has with a daughter when she's 12," replied Colbert, after she noted that her dad ultimately "won" the war. He then asked whether they went someplace "private" to fight it out or if it was a "knock-down, drag-out in front of the crew."</p><p>"No, it was very public," she responded.</p><p>At this point, her famous father jumped in and explained the situation. "Once it was clear that she was making the wrong decision, I just went and sat down," he claimed, "and then the silence was one the crew had to live with for two hours while the Penns figured it out."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:a87934be-84d2-4e7c-9b83-fdbc087b9108 data-container-ref=toofab:article:d07671f3-e8ed-4d26-a9ff-2b43510aa381 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=28><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/56/5by4/2020/11/18/566fcd36b3fd4d70bf3a7fc7e88f3bcc_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Facebook</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Sean Penn is Torn to Shreds by Kate del Castillo and Gloria Estefan Over El Chapo Debacle on Red Table Talk</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>During the interview, Colbert also wondered if Dylan, despite being the child of two very famous stars, still had "regular actor jobs" while trying to make it in the entertainment industry. Apparently, she did.</p><p>"I worked in service waiting tables, I hosted, I was an unpaid intern at an ad agency. Then I moved to L.A. to go to school and I actually started delivering pizzas for a living. It was very humbling," noted Dylan, who said she was working as a model by day and pizza delivery woman at night, most times heading straight from a shoot to her second job.</p><p>"I was delivering to a lot of fraternities here in L.A. and I would show up to the door in full hair and makeup with my pizza hat," she noted. "They'd be like, 'Guys, I think the stripper's here.' I'm like, 'No, no, I actually have a pizza!"</p><p>Their film "Flag Day" is in theaters now.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:7f90b977-2530-4d4c-8f6b-f097ca968034 data-container-ref=toofab:article:d07671f3-e8ed-4d26-a9ff-2b43510aa381 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/81/5by4/2021/08/05/81d79e7b580b428ea9e6f113798af630_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Everett Collection</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Amazing Thread of A-Listers in Miami Vice 'Before They Were Famous'</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3J7j3Fma2hfmcatrc1mp56mnmLApq3NZqeepp5is62txmabmrFdm7aotNNo</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./stages-of-dark-spots-on-skin.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>The Stages of a Dark Spot</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./peanut-nasheed-tariq-nasheeds-wife-wiki-net-worth-spouse-family-background-photos-measurement-and-more.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Peanut Nasheed (Tariq Nasheed's Wife) Wiki, Net Worth, Spouse, Family Background, Photos, Measuremen</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./409878-100-summer-instagram-captions-sunny-funny-html.html>100+ summer Instagram captions that are sunny and funny</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-neck-cream.html>19 Best Neck Creams of 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./angelina-jolie-daughter-vivienne-resembles-brad-pitt-new-photo.html>Angelina Jolie's daughter Vivienne looks just like Brad Pitt in new photo from momentous outing toge</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chicagos-summer-smash-festival-signs-a-ticketing-deal-with-dice.html>Chicagos Summer Smash Festival Signs A Ticketing Deal With DICE</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./fosters-voice-reaching-his-peers-with-organization-of-school-club.html>Foster's Voice reaching his peers with organization of school club</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog.
