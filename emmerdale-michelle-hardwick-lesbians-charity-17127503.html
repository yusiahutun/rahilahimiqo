Viewers know that Charity had a turbulent past but what she reveals is truly terrible. She has known DI Bails – the policeman who is currently helping Vanessa’s sister with her court case – since she was on the streets aged 14. And he’s beyond dangerous.</p><p>“So she’s torn. She can’t stay loyal to Charity as well as risking jeopardising her relationship by trying to protect her sister.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article15229164.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_les1-694874><p>At the end of tonight’s episode viewers will not only know the extent of Charity’s grave past but also see Vanessa make the biggest mistake in trying to help her.</p><p>Michelle says: “It’s a side to Charity that we’ve never, ever seen. She doesn’t talk about this, we just know that she’s a tough character who rarely shows any weakness.</p><p>“Viewers will finally understand why she is how she is with me and why she’s so guarded and difficult with people generally.</p><p>“It’s a real, loving relationship for both of them, which is why Vanessa doing what she does threatens to ruin all of that.”</p><p>Since last October soap fans have been loving the burning romance between landlady Charity (played by Emma Atkins) and formerly straight vet Vanessa Woodfield.</p><a class=gallery-interaction href=# data-link-tracking=inArticle|slideshow><span>Naughtiest soap scenes</span> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article19372426.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/0_1305838> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article15229165.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_les2-1294631> <span class=label>View gallery</span></a><p>They’ve had lots of steamy scenes such as getting caught in the act by fellow villagers and fans have loved watching Vanessa come to terms with her own sexuality on screen.</p><p>Michelle explains: “Who knew Vanessa and Charity could have become the hottest couple in the Dales? There’s been so many fun scenes since they had that drunken kiss in the cellar last October, such as when Charity said she’d locked the door of the vet’s surgery and got her on the table and then Paddy walked in and caught them.</p><p>“Charity opened Vanessa’s eyes to her sexuality and they’ve gone on a journey together. She loves the fun and excitement of it all.”</p><p>Many fans have come forward to say the storyline has helped them come out to their friends too.</p><p>“We have such a huge following online, we’re thrilled,” she says.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>“I did a gig recently as part of the Emmerdale band and loads of #Vanity fans travelled from all over the country just to thank us.</p><p>“They told me that they were proud to be out and that they are who they are now because of this story. Before they’d never been able to talk about being gay and they’d all met on Twitter while watching the show and they formed a WhatsApp group. It’s like we’ve formed a little community which is so great. I definitely didn’t have that when I came out.</p><p>“I didn’t know anyone else who was a lesbian at that time.</p><p>“Perhaps being a lesbian did give me an advantage playing this role because I do understand it and what Vanessa is going through, I cared and was invested in the storyline because it was personal to me. When you do hear the stories of the young girls who are sharing their coming-out stories it does make you feel proud that you’ve helped them with that.”</p><p>In real life Michelle married her long-term partner Rosie in April 2015 but last year she exclusively revealed to the Daily Star that she’d got divorced.</p><p>She admits: “Last year was really tough, I went through the divorce, my grandad died and then I lost my best friend in the whole world, my grandma. But I’m in a good place now and actually feel the happiest I’ve been in a long time. I’m picking up a new puppy, a cavapoo called Fred, which I am excited about.</p><p>“Me and my partner are ridiculously in love and happy and it’s lovely. I’ve decided this time round to keep this relationship private. I have been divorced nearly a year now and we split up way before that. But would I get married again? Yes! I don’t even hesitate with that.</p><p>“What would be even better would be for Charity and Vanessa to have a big soap wedding! Who knows if they will get that far though.”</p><p>Michelle couldn’t be happier that soaps aren’t afraid to reflect issues such as sexuality any more.</p><p>She says: “I still look back now at the Anna Friel Brookside kiss and what massive news it was at the time and I’m so grateful for how soaps and society have moved on from that. We’re just people falling in love.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>“It doesn’t matter. It’s not hurting anyone! It’s only by soaps taking on storylines that reflect real life, which Brookside did so well back then, that helps to get people talking and accepting.</p><p>“That’s what we want to do and Emmerdale is brilliant at that. The dropping of labels is a big part of it too, you don’t have to be lesbian or bisexual, you don’t have to put a name on it.”</p><p>She defends Corrie and Emmerdale against criticism for recent shocking storylines. “You need to tell stories on soaps,” she says.</p><p>“If you didn’t it would get boring. Old school Corrie would see a character buy a new coat and that would be the highlight of the episode. We have to move with the times.</p><p>“We need to take on current issues and get people discussing them. So what better platform than a soap opera which is going into your house every night of the week? You can’t always please everyone. And long may that continue!”</p><p>● Watch Emmerdale tonight at 7pm on ITV.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCsrJGne6S7ja6iaKymZLKuucSrm5qklWK6qq%2FHnqOlnV2drrOw1qKapGWcmsCjtcCnqmabmJa%2FqsDYZmhwaWJsgnF%2F</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./vinland-saga-will-there-be-a-season-three-of-anime-series-heres-everything-we-know-about-manga-adaptation-1226403.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Vinland Saga: Will there be season three of anime series?
