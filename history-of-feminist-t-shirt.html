You’ve committed to your message, and it’s there in plain sight across your chest for everyone to see.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=1 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Feminist activists have been using T-shirts to challenge a culture that denies women and others their basic rights for decades—and to keep pushing social justice movements themselves to be more inclusive. In the same way that posting a feminist or anti-racist meme on social media is not a substitute for the hard work of political organizing and action, there’s certainly a limit to the T-shirt’s political power. Without any further activism behind it, a T-shirt is just cotton fabric. Yet, fashion, like social media, can increase visibility, which in turn can make a political message more accessible and approachable, and more widely seen, forcing itself into the cultural conversation.</p><img alt="lavender menace tee" title="lavender menace tee" width=3000 height=2091 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/diana-davies-copy-1617220904.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Diana Davies</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Feminist fashion extends back before the advent of the T-shirt in the late 19th century. (Suffragists were known for wearing white, for example, and Macy’s was even the “official headquarters” for suffrage paraphernalia—perhaps the earliest known example of what Andi Zeisler calls <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.gendereconomy.org/andi-zeisler-on-marketplace-feminism/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="“marketplace feminism.”" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">“marketplace feminism.”</a>) But one particular T-shirt made waves during the women’s liberation movement of the 1960s and ’70s. In 1969, Betty Friedan, a leader of the National Organization for Women (NOW), used the term lavender menace to dismiss an outspoken sect of lesbian women in the group advocating for NOW to include equal rights for lesbians within their group’s goals. Friedan and others worried that association with lesbians would be bad for NOW overall and distanced the organization from lesbian causes. In response, lesbian activists including Rita Mae Brown and Karla Jay <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://affinitymagazine.us/2016/10/22/remembering-the-lavender-menace/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="formed a group called Lavender Menace" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">formed a group called Lavender Menace</a>, reclaiming Friedan’s phrase, and famously revealed T-shirts printed with the slogan at a meeting of the Second Congress to Unite Women in 1970. “Yes, yes, sisters! I’m tired of being in the closet because of the women’s movement,” Jay <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.them.us/story/lavender-menace data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=shouted class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">shouted</a> as she unbuttoned her blouse to reveal a Lavender Menace shirt. This attention-grabbing demonstration contributed to Friedan later apologizing and NOW pivoting to include lesbian rights within its agenda.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">This same shirt that was used to highlight how lesbian rights were left out of the second-wave feminist movement was later adapted to call attention to discrimination against trans people, both within mainstream gay and lesbian spaces, and in society at large. <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/09/08/us/shunning-he-and-she-they-fight-for-respect.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="The Transexual Menace" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">The Transexual Menace</a>, the first direct action group for transgender rights, was formed in 1993 by activists Riki Wilchins and Denise Norris in reaction to widespread violence and harassment against trans people. The group’s visual trademark was a goth-style shirt modeled after The Rocky Horror Picture Show logo, which marchers wore at demonstrations to encourage trans visibility and center trans issues. “If you passed [as cis], you were safe,” Wilchins <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://businessequalitymagazine.com/transgressive-riki-wilchins-gender-rights-future-transgender-activism/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="described in her 2017 book " class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">described in her 2017 book </a><a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://businessequalitymagazine.com/transgressive-riki-wilchins-gender-rights-future-transgender-activism/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=TRANS/gressive class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">TRANS/gressive</a>. “But pulling on the T-shirt screwed all of that forever."</p><img alt="transexual menace t shirt" title="transexual menace t shirt" width=3000 height=1989 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/mariette-pathy-allen-copy-1617221228.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">© Mariette Pathy Allen</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Maxine Wolfe, a coordinator of the Lesbian Herstory Archives and keeper of the archive’s T-shirt collection, champions the power of political T-shirts. “People wonder why we would save T-shirts,” she tells BAZAAR.com over the phone. “Most people, when they think about politics, they don’t think about T-shirts. But I think that [making or wearing T-shirts] is one of those things that people have been doing forever as a way of creating an identity and being visible.”</p><img alt="salsa soul sisters tee" title="salsa soul sisters tee" width=1446 height=1037 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/salsashirts-pat-r-chin-1617284932.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Pat R.

Salsa Soul Sisters formed out of the Black Lesbian Caucus of the gay liberation movement in the mid-’70s in response to existing gay organizations neither welcoming nor supporting the concerns of women of color. The group held regular community meetings on topics including racism and single lesbian parenting, and published Azalea: A Magazine by Third World Lesbians and the Salsa Soul Gayzette. They would often wear T-shirts featuring their organization’s name and logo to marches and other events to spread awareness. In the ’80s and ’90s during the AIDS crisis, T-shirts with messages like, “Who’s the Cure For,” and, “Woman with AIDS Dead Not Disabled,” were part of the efforts of ACT UP’s National Women’s Committee to draw attention to women with AIDS, who were left out of laws addressing the disease and excluded from receiving disability.</p><img alt="act up protest at fda" title="Act Up Protest At FDA" width=4544 height=2988 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/activist-group-act-up-protest-at-the-headquarters-of-the-news-photo-1617120673.?crop=0.658xw:1.00xh;0.141xw" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Catherine McGann</span><span class="css-5ck6gj e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span><p>An "ACT UP" T-shirt spotted in Rockville, Maryland in 1988.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">T-shirts have also been used as corrective advertising. During the late ’80s and early ’90s, an era when feminism was derided by conservative leaders and media personalities like Rush Limbaugh, whose term feminazi was adopted by broader culture, the Feminist Majority Foundation (FMF) was on a mission to take back the word feminist. “We deliberately named ourselves Feminist Majority, because we viewed it as a consciousness raiser,” FMF executive director and Ms. executive editor Kathy Spillar says. Despite the widespread negative image of feminism, the majority of women polled at the time self-identified as feminists, she adds. The organization debuted a T-shirt featuring the slogan, “This Is What a Feminist Looks Like,” for a pro-choice march on Washington, D.C., in 1992. “We wanted to fight back against the negative images that had been created around feminism,” Spillar explains. “We wanted to popularize the term, and we wanted feminists to be proud that they’re feminists.” Ms. did a <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Ms._magazine_Cover_-_Spring_2003.jpg data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="2003 cover" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">2003 cover</a> featuring celebrities including Whoopi Goldberg and Margaret Cho wearing the shirt, and a <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.democracynow.org/2009/1/27/ms_magazine_on_barack_obama_this data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="2009 cover" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">2009 cover</a> with then President Barack Obama wearing it. The now iconic T-shirt has helped to encourage a diverse, inclusive image of feminism that pushes back on negative stereotypes.</p><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span>We wanted feminists to be proud that they’re feminists.<span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Activists have also used T-shirts to help spread awareness and push boundaries around reproductive justice. In 2004, Planned Parenthood began selling <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-2004-08-04-0408040194-story.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="shirts featuring the declaration, “I had an abortion.”" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">shirts featuring the declaration, “I had an abortion.”</a> Created by feminist writer Jennifer Baumgardner alongside a film she made around that time, Speak Out: I Had an Abortion, the shirt was meant to destigmatize the common procedure and put names and faces to the issue. While in 2004’s conservative political climate it seemed taboo even to acknowledge getting the procedure, newer T-shirts are even more unapologetic in breaking abortion stigmas. Viva Ruiz’s <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.thankgodforabortion.com/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="“Thank God for Abortion” shirt" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">“Thank God for Abortion” shirt</a> was created in 2015, in response to the closing of abortion clinics throughout the U.S. The shirt, available in several languages, reads, “Thank God for Abortion,” and features outreached hands and a dove. Ruiz’s shirt resists the dichotomy of being either pro-choice or religious, insisting that abortion is a normal, shame-free part of life.</p><img alt="the future is female tee" title="the future is female tee" width=2038 height=2038 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/liza-cowan-1617220968.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Liza Cowan</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In the mid-2010s, feminism—and feminist fashion—took an unprecedented turn toward the mainstream. From Wildfang’s “Wild Feminist” tee to Thugz Maison’s <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2015/03/83532/willow-smith-feminist-t-shirt data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="“Goddesses Shirt”" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">“Goddesses Shirt”</a> highlighting important feminists of color, and even <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.businessinsider.com/dior-we-should-all-be-feminists-shirt-2017-3 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Dior’s $710 shirt" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Dior’s $710 shirt</a> featuring Nigerian feminist author Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie’s quote “We Should All Be Feminists,” T-shirts promoting women’s empowerment were suddenly everywhere. In some ways, these massive troves of T-shirts, found everywhere from runways to H&M, depoliticized the substance of feminism by divorcing the term from the still-urgent fight for so many women’s rights. But in another sense, the ability for the masses to embrace feminist fashion helped make feminism more palatable and approachable for younger generations. Perhaps the most popular feminist tee at the time was the “The Future Is Female” T-shirt. <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2017/02/08/hillary-clinton-just-said-it-but-the-future-is-female-began-as-a-1970s-lesbian-separatist-slogan/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="First photographed in the 1970s by Liza Cowan, the shirt was created for Labyris Books," class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">First photographed in the 1970s by Liza Cowan, the shirt was created for Labyris Books,</a> New York City’s first feminist bookstore, and was re-created by L.A. retailer Otherwild in 2015. “If we are to have a future, it must be female,” Cowan told The Washington Post, “because the rule of men—patriarchy—has just about devastated life on this beautiful little planet.” The slogan has since been adapted to include shirts that say everything from the corrective, “The Future Is Non-binary,” to the pragmatic, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.riseupmidwife.com/collections/fall-2019-collection/products/the-future-is-accessible-midwifery-care-tee data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="“The Future Is Accessible Midwifery Care.” " class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">“The Future Is Accessible Midwifery Care.”</a><br></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">During the Trump presidency, new waves of activism brought with them slogan T-shirts that ditched the playful, abstract feel of their fast-fashion predecessors for a more direct, serious tone. When Mitch McConnell scolded Elizabeth Warren for criticizing Jeff Sessions’s record on civil rights, McConnell’s words, “Nevertheless, she persisted,” were repurposed as a rallying cry for women refusing to be silenced, and they were plastered across everything from T-shirts to bumper stickers. At the height of the #MeToo movement in 2017, retailers like <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://americahates.us/shopahus/believe-womens-tee-mens data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="America Hates Us" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">America Hates Us</a> sold “Believe Women” T-shirts to help “obliterate the patriarchal standard that creates a deterrent for women to report attacks against them.” During widespread Black Lives Matter activism last summer, “Say Her Name,” the slogan created by Kimberlé Crenshaw and the African American Policy Forum five years earlier to bring attention to the stories of Black women killed by the police, was worn on T-shirts by many protesters, as well as <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/29/sports/basketball/Angel-McCoughtry-breonna-taylor.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="WNBA players" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">WNBA players</a><u>,</u> to draw attention to the movement.</p><img alt="minnesota lynx v seattle storm game two" title="Minnesota Lynx v Seattle Storm - Game Two" width=1024 height=763 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/alysha-clark-and-jewell-loyd-of-the-seattle-storm-both-wear-news-photo-1617222125.?resize=768:*" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Julio Aguilar</span><span class="css-5ck6gj e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">T-shirts alone can’t replace real, material activism for social change, but they act as a visual reminder of the important and varied work feminist activists have been doing for the past five-plus decades. Now that Women’s History Month has come to a close, we should reflect on the very movement that sparked International Women’s Day: female <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/culture/politics/a35696959/garment-workers-international-womens-day/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="garment workers" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">garment workers</a> fighting for better labor conditions. When it comes to the future of feminist T-shirts, we can look more and more to fashion retailers that use ethical labor practices and responsible materials, and support women, prioritizing not just the people who wear or profit from these shirts, but also the livelihoods of those who make them. After all, if the work of feminists—and the T-shirts they’ve worn—have taught us anything, it’s the importance of centering the voices, experiences, and concerns of the most marginalized among us—of evolving or ending up on the wrong side of history.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">This story has been updated.</p><span class="css-1s9owpq ev8dhu51"><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/f13957b2-d2c4-43ba-a370-ef706b3dedd4_1594406480.file?fill=1:1&resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Marisa Crawford" title="Headshot of Marisa Crawford" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Marisa Crawford is currently co-editing, with Megan Milks, a book on the cultural impact of The Baby-Sitters Club, forthcoming from Chicago Review Press.
