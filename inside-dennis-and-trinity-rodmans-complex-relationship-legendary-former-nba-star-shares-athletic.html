She once lived at the Orange Country Comfort Inn with her mum, brother and elder sister Teyana Lima, Moyer’s daughter from a previous marriage. Per ESPN, Moyer spoke about eating free waffles in the hotel lobby and scoring free lunch at school for her kids. Rodman hardly saw his children and despite having a famous surname, his children didn’t appear to benefit from his stardom.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">Dennis Rodman’s “demons”</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/08/07/73454039-3954-4840-a9da-7d3d677f92f7_65904288.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In another interview with ESPN in 2019, Dennis said he was estranged from his own father for years. He added that he wanted to be a better father to his own children, telling the publication that his major “demon” was trying to “convince myself that I am a good dad”. He admitted to feeling “detached” from his children, explaining that he felt he only ever heard from them when they needed or wanted something. He always felt like people asked him for material things and found it hard to separate the requests of his children from that of strangers, he said.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/08/07/8321d119-d389-4efe-93c6-af34a67fc452_8a66ae79.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">He also confessed that his children did not approve of the fact that he wore make-up and experimented with dressing up.
