In case you’re not familiar, the <a href=#>music</a> star began re-recording her previous albums (known as Taylor’s Version) after not being able to purchase the rights to her original masters. At the moment, <a href=#>Taylor Swift</a> is yet to release the new recordings of her self-titled debut album and 2017’s Reputation. Reputation was themed around snakes and featured hits like Look What You Made Me Do and Delicate.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-travis-kelce-s-look-screams-the-fact-he-s-heard-reputation-tv-vault-tracks>Travis Kelce’s look ‘screams’ the fact he’s heard Reputation TV Vault Tracks</h2><p>In a video shared to <a href=#>Instagram</a>, the 34-year-old can be seen strutting down a hallway while wearing a checkered jacket, leather pants, and a pair of shades. The text onscreen <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">reads</a>: “This is the look of a man who’s heard the Vault Tracks from REP TV.”</p><p>They added green and black heart emojis, along with the obligatory snake ones.</p><p>Fans rushed to the comments to share their thoughts on the clip. They have theories on whether Travis Kelce has heard the Vault Tracks Taylor Swift may have recorded for Reputation TV.</p><p><strong>MORE: </strong><a href=#>Taylor Swift songs we suspect could actually be about her cats instead of ex-lovers</a></p><p>“I know Taylor and him are hanging out looking at all of the TikToks that are fan theories of release dates, and they’re just snickering about how far from the correct theory we are [laughing emoji],” wrote one person.</p><p>Another commented: “She is a mastermind – his fit, his walk, everything screaaaaams rep tv and I love it.”</p><p>A third penned: “He was Reputation-coded like [clapping hands emoji].”</p><p>A fourth Swiftie said: “Can you imagine him being so supportive that he starts wearing rep-coded fits? Like intentionally? Not even because Taylor asked him to but because he knows it’ll be his biggest show of support for her and bc it’ll drive us nuts.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-taylor-previously-said-the-vaulty-tracks-are-fire>Taylor previously said the Vaulty Tracks are ‘fire’</h2><p>In 2023, Taylor Swift opened up about the Reputation Vault Tracks, which fans are convinced <a href=#>Travis Kelce</a> has heard. The <a href=#>celebrity</a> told TIME during her Person of the Year interview fans can expect the new songs to be “fire.”</p><p>“It’s a goth-punk moment of female rage at being gaslit by an entire social structure. I think a lot of people see it and they’re just like, Sick snakes and strobe lights,” she said. <a href=#>Talking about this era</a>, she referred to Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings and said she was “collecting Horcruxes.”</p><p>“I’m collecting infinity stones. Gandalf’s voice is in my head every time I put out a new one. For me, it is a <a href=#>movie</a> now.”</p><p>The 34-year-old <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">explained</a> she was impacted “physiologically” around that time and became “isolated.” This was due to the drama involving rapper Kanye West and his then-wife Kim Kardashian, crude lyrics, and an unknowingly-recorded phone call.</p><p>She explained she moved to a “foreign country” and didn’t leave her rental house for a year. The star spoke about pushing people away and being afraid to get on “phone calls”.</p><p>Taylor continued: “I went down really, really hard.”</p><p>“I thought that moment of backlash was going to define me negatively for the rest of my life,” said the other half of the <a href=#>celebrity couple</a>.</p><p><strong>MORE:</strong> <a href=#>Travis Kelce offered ‘free $1 million engagement ring’ for Taylor Swift</a></p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFtZmlpX2eAcMDAsqOoql2oxKqy02admqajYrewt8Rmq6uZpp7AbrfEpZqeZZykvKy%2FjKWgpJ1dlnqurc1mrqGnXZ2utHnHnpirnF2nsrHB05qroqeeYsOiwcutZK2qkZi4tHs%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./kim-kardashian-nude-selfie-chloe-grace-moretz-bette-midler-piers-morgan.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Kim Kardashian Posts Another Nude Pic After Being Slammed by Chloe Grace Moretz, Bette Midler &amp;amp; More</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./hkr-slip-on-nurse-sneakers-amazon-8636212.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Nurses Are Wearing These Comfy $35 Amazon Sneakers for 12-Hour Shifts</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./409878-100-summer-instagram-captions-sunny-funny-html.html>100+ summer Instagram captions that are sunny and funny</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-neck-cream.html>19 Best Neck Creams of 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./angelina-jolie-daughter-vivienne-resembles-brad-pitt-new-photo.html>Angelina Jolie's daughter Vivienne looks just like Brad Pitt in new photo from momentous outing toge</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chicagos-summer-smash-festival-signs-a-ticketing-deal-with-dice.html>Chicagos Summer Smash Festival Signs A Ticketing Deal With DICE</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./fosters-voice-reaching-his-peers-with-organization-of-school-club.html>Foster's Voice reaching his peers with organization of school club</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog.
