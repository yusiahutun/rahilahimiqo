Most recently, the news that <a href=#>King Charles</a> has put a <a href=#>strict ban on selfies for guests attending his Christmas dinner</a> surfaced. Moreover, the news that the King has <a href=#>invited his stepchildren</a> but snubbed Harry and Meghan from his Christmas guest list also made rounds. Now an expert claims that <a href=#>Meghan Markle</a> and <a href=#>Prince Harry</a> released their Archewell Foundation video hours after Kate’s public appearance with her children out of “envy.”</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/12/GettyImages-1241073045-1024x699.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-harry-and-meghan-are-envious-of-kate-middleton>Harry and Meghan are ‘envious’ of Kate Middleton</h2><p>During her recent appearance on GB News, American journalist Kinsey Schofield <a href=# rel=nofollow>shared</a> her thoughts on Harry and Meghan releasing their Archewell Foundation video a day after <a href=#>Kate Middleton</a>‘s public appearance with her kids. The Princess of Wales took her three kids Princes George, Louis, and Princess Charlotte to a Baby Bank in Maidenhead, Berkshire on December 11. They sorted out essential goods for children and families in need.</p><p>The Sussexes Archewell video came out a day later. They shared glimpses of all their charity work in 2023. One of the clips showed them participating in the Responsible Technology Youth Power Fund initiative trying to “<a href=#>take back their narrative</a>.” They phoned the young entrepreneurs selected for the&nbsp;inaugural $2 million funding&nbsp;round.</p><p>The GB News journalist asked Schofield her thoughts about Meghan and Harry releasing their video a day after Princess Catherine was “actually doing proper charity work.” The journalist also questions if Meghan and Harry are always trying to get “one up on Kate.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/12/Screenshot-2023-12-23-at-7.36.46-PM-1024x487.png><p>To this Schofield responds saying, “I do think there’s an element of envy” Schofield says. She opines that the Sussexes feel envious of the royal family’s magical celebration of the holidays. “There is a sense of magic and surprise,” she says. She also notes how fans are keen to say Kate and Prince William’s kids during this time too.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-expert-says-2023-has-been-the-worst-year-for-the-sussexes>Expert says 2023 has been “the worst year” for the Sussexes</h2><p>“This has been professionally the worst year of Harry and Meghan’s lives,” Schofield says. She also notes how the couple usually puts this sort of video out in January of the next year, unlike this time when they released it in mid-December.</p><p>“They are trying to distract from the fact that everybody is recognizing that they failed hard this year,” she says.</p><p>She also opines the Sussexes don’t want to enter 2024 with the “stamp of losers” on their foreheads.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-meghan-and-harry-have-been-named-2023-s-biggest-loosers>Meghan and Harry have been named 2023’s ‘biggest loosers’</h2><p>The Duke and Duchess’ failed $20 million Spotify deal has been much talked about by the media. However, adding insult to injury was The Hollywood Reporter’s 2023 winners and losers list that came out in the first week of December.</p><p>The winners’ list included the likes of <a href=#>Taylor Swift</a>, Greta Gerwig, and Margot Robbie. The loser’s list on the other hand included Meghan and Harry’s names as losers in the list.</p><p>The outlet noted how South Park’s dig at the Sussexes acted like a pin for their “sanctimonious bubble.” The sitcom famously released a 20-minute segment named “World-Wide Privacy Tour” in March 2023. It was a massive dig at Harry and Meghan and generated a series of bad press for the couple.</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFsZmpqX2eAcLfArZxmpZmZsa2x06ilrGWdlrSqr4yiqmamn6x6rq3KoqWgZZiWv7PFjJqlnWWdmrSprc1mnKeumaTCtHs%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./cruella-villains-black-and-white-hair-is-an-actual-hereditary-condition-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>The Villain's Black and White Hair Is an Actual Hereditary Condition</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./guardianobituaries-artsobituaries.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Fritha Goodey | Film | The Guardian</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./409878-100-summer-instagram-captions-sunny-funny-html.html>100+ summer Instagram captions that are sunny and funny</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-neck-cream.html>19 Best Neck Creams of 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./angelina-jolie-daughter-vivienne-resembles-brad-pitt-new-photo.html>Angelina Jolie's daughter Vivienne looks just like Brad Pitt in new photo from momentous outing toge</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chicagos-summer-smash-festival-signs-a-ticketing-deal-with-dice.html>Chicagos Summer Smash Festival Signs A Ticketing Deal With DICE</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./fosters-voice-reaching-his-peers-with-organization-of-school-club.html>Foster's Voice reaching his peers with organization of school club</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog.
