This occurs when the muscles in the airway, which naturally relax as we fall asleep, completely collapse; this shuts off breathing for up to ten seconds at a time.</p><img id=i-cd33c1263b36b008 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2023/09/11/20/75306987-12506061-image-a-1_1694460622266.jpg height=634 width=634 alt="To drink from the new straw you have to use your tongue to press the nozzle against the roof of the mouth; this then opens a valve in the straw that releases water from the bottle (stock image)" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>To drink from the new straw you have to use your tongue to press the nozzle against the roof of the mouth; this then opens a valve in the straw that releases water from the bottle (stock image)</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Once the brain realises breathing has stopped, it sends a signal for the airway muscles to contract again to open the airway.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Sleep apnoea has been shown to raise blood pressure and the threat of a stroke or heart attack because of reduced oxygen supply. Treatment usually consists of continuous positive airway pressure, where patients wear a mask that gently forces air into the airway to stop them collapsing as they sleep.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>But some people find the mask cumbersome and research suggests that nearly a third never use it or abandon it within weeks.

This activates a valve which lets water pass up the straw. In the new trial, patients with sleep apnoea will be given identical bottles to drink from for 60 days — half will have the special nozzle and half an ordinary one.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Researchers will assess the severity of their snoring before and after the trial using the Calgary Sleep Apnea Quality of Life Index, a scoring system that assesses factors such as memory and concentration.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Initial results of the trial are expected early next year.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Data from a small study, run by the manufacturer, showed a third of users reported reduced daytime drowsiness after using the bottle for just a month.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Independent sleep expert Dr Neil Stanley said: 'We know exercising the tongue and throat can reduce snoring.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'But we'll have to wait for the results of the Mayo Clinic study before we know if this bottle is of any real benefit.'</p>&nbsp;<p class=mol-para-with-font><span class=mol-style-bold>Insomnia may increase the risk of thinning bones in women, according to research by the University of Greifswald in Germany.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span class=mol-style-bold>They studied more than 1,000 volunteers and found those with insomnia had the lowest bone density, putting them at risk of fractures.
