The Disney classic is beloved by many late-'80s and early-'90s kids, who watched and sang along with Ariel's journey to dry land—and falling in love with a human prince.

Fans of The Princess and the Frog and the Brandy-starring Cinderella know another Black Disney princess is long overdue. Though the film's release date has yet to be announced, I'm ready to buy my tickets now.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">As we wait, here's everything else we know about the forthcoming movie.<br></p><h2 data-node-id=4 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">The Little Mermaid will premiere in theaters on May 26, 2023.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Disney announced in September 2021 that its live-action remake will hit theaters on Memorial Day weekend in 2023, per <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/disneys-live-action-the-little-mermaid-memorial-day-weekend-opening-1235011622/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=T class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">T</a><a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/disneys-live-action-the-little-mermaid-memorial-day-weekend-opening-1235011622/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="he Hollywood Reporter" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">he Hollywood Reporter</a>. Halle Bailey revealed that production had wrapped on the film in an Instagram post the previous June, where she also shared a <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a37001907/halle-bailey-ariel-little-mermaid-photo/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="first look of our live-action Ariel" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">first look of our live-action Ariel</a>. "I cannot wait for time to speed up so you all can watch this film because it was made with so much love (plus blood sweat and tears)," she wrote. See the full official trailer, below.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">After a year's worth of anticipation, Disney finally released the first look at the film yesterday. The brief teaser (seen above) shows Bailey as mermaid Ariel, swimming through her sunken ship hideout and her room of treasures, followed closely by Flounder in one shot. It ends with a close up on Ariel as she sings the famous refrain of "Part of Your World" (with a lovely added run).</p><h2 data-node-id=9 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">Bailey will officially star as Ariel.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Rob Marshall, the film's director, released a statement on July 3, 2019, saying, "After an extensive search, it was abundantly clear that Halle possesses that rare combination of spirit, heart, youth, innocence, and substance—plus a glorious singing voice—all intrinsic qualities necessary to play this iconic role."</p><p>Bailey shared her excitement on Twitter, calling the casting a "dream come true."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">There hasn't been an African-American Disney princess since Anika Noni Rose voiced Tiana in 2009. This level of representation is equally a dream come true for many Black girls around the world.</p><h2 data-node-id=14 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">The film's official teasers are simply stunning.</h2><img alt="ariel the little mermaid halle bailey" title="THE LITTLE MERMAID" width=1688 height=2500 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/thelittlemermaid-digital-teaser-keyart-v4-lg-1665682261.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Disney</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Disney released the first official poster for the upcoming live adaption film that features solely Bailey in costume as Ariel under the sea — no pun intended. Bailey wrote a sentimental caption on Instagram alongside sharing the image writing, "Words can’t describe how immensely honored I feel to play the mermaid of my dreams, Ariel in Disney’s The Little Mermaid."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Bailey also shared a short clip of herself as Ariel in her underwater world exactly 100 days from the film's official release in theaters. The new teaser also includes our first look at Melissa McCarthy's portrayal of the film's ultra villain, Ursula.</p><h2 data-node-id=19 class="css-p3fpzg emevuu60">Jonah Hauer-King will play Prince Eric.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">After <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.nme.com/news/music/harry-styles-reveals-reason-decline-role-prince-eric-little-mermaid-2564136 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Harry Styles reportedly turned down the role" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Harry Styles reportedly turned down the role</a>, Disney casted Jonah Hauer-King as The Little Mermaid's Prince Eric, according to <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://deadline.com/2019/11/little-mermaid-jonah-hauer-king-wins-roles-of-prince-eric-1202784503/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Deadline class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Deadline</a>.

Her vocal performance is just as gorgeous too, per the director.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=29 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“When she finished, I was in tears because she’s so soulful,” Marshall told the outlet about hearing Bailey's first rendition of 'Part of Your World'. “You could tell right away that she was able to harness Ariel’s passion, her fire, her soul, her joy and her heart.”</p><h2 data-node-id=30 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">Lin-Manuel Miranda will write music for the new movie.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=31 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Hamilton creator Lin-Manuel Miranda will work alongside Alan Menken, who wrote the original movie's music with the late lyricist Howard Ashman, to craft additional music for the remake. Miranda most recently worked with Disney to write music for 2016's Moana, and is also a producer on this movie.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=33 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">He <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.vulture.com/2016/11/lin-manuel-miranda-making-a-secret-disney-film.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="told Vulture in 2016" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">told Vulture in 2016</a> that he's "intimidated" about the project. "This came out of a conversation with Disney, and basically they were like, 'There's no bigger fan of this movie than you, and no bigger public supporter,'" Miranda recalled. Talk about pressure.</p><h2 data-node-id=35 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">Miranda will also reunite with his Mary Poppins Returns director Rob Marshall.</h2><img alt="People, Event, Carpet, Suit, Formal wear, Premiere, Ceremony, Family, " title="People, Event, Carpet, Suit, Formal wear, Premiere, Ceremony, Family, " width=681 height=1024 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/mary-poppins-1562691005.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span><p>Miranda and Marshall (far right) with Emily Blunt and John Deluca.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=37 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Marshall will direct the film from a script written by Jane Goldman (Miss Peregrine’s Home for Peculiar Children). He and Miranda are fresh off a successful collaboration for the Disney sequel Mary Poppins Returns, but Marshall's experience with musicals goes far beyond that. He also directed Into the Woods, Nine, and the Oscar-nominated Chicago.</p><h2 data-node-id=38 class="css-p3fpzg emevuu60">The original Ariel has defended Bailey's casting following backlash.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=39 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">After Bailey's role was announced, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://thegrapevine.theroot.com/notmyariel-white-twitter-is-big-mad-about-disney-cast-1836128376 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="the hashtag #NotMyAriel" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">the hashtag #NotMyAriel</a> began circulating around Twitter. Many people argued that the singer was completely wrong for the role because the Ariel made popular from the 1989 animated film was Danish and had red hair.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=40 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Freeform defended its network star in an open letter addressed to the "Poor, Unfortunate Souls." The post explained that "Danish mermaids can be Black because Danish people can be Black" and that "the character of Ariel is a work of fiction."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=42 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Even actress Jodi Benson, who voiced Ariel in the 1989 movie, defended Bailey's casting. "The most important thing is to tell the story. And we have, as a family, we have raised our children, and for ourselves, that we don’t see anything that’s different on the outside,” Benson said during a July 2019 fan convention, according to <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://comicbook.com/movies/2019/07/07/the-little-mermaid-original-ariel-actress-jodi-benson-defends-halle-bailey-casting-disney-live-action-remake/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=ComicBook.com class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">ComicBook.com</a>. "And no matter what we look like on the outside, no matter our race, our nation, the color of our skin, our dialect, whether I'm tall or thin, whether I'm overweight or underweight, or my hair is whatever color, we really need to tell the story."<br></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=43 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Bailey addressed the controversy for the first time in a cover story for <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://variety.com/2022/film/features/halle-bailey-the-little-mermaid-interview-backlash-ariel-1235336668/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Variety class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Variety</a> expressing how the backlash initially affected her.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=44 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“It’s important to have a strong support system around you. It’s hard to carry the weight of the world on your own," said the actress in the interview. "[But] it was an inspiring and beautiful thing to hear [my grandparents's] words of encouragement, telling me, ‘You don’t understand what this is doing for us, for our community, for all the little Black and brown girls who are going to see themselves in you.’”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=45 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">She also acknowledged how seeing an Ariel that looked like her decades prior would have changed not just her outlook on the world but of herself. “What that would have done for me, how that would have changed my confidence, my belief in myself, everything,” she said. “Things that seem so small to everyone else, it’s so big to us.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qa3RqZyrq5KWx6Kt0WeaqKVfmMKtwNSrnGiemaG6bsDVaJhrcGNng3R9lGijoqykobJuucSrpJqhlGK%2FprnApJxmoJGhuaZ5wZqgpZ2pYrumw9Jmm5qslWKwor%2FTZqqpp5mhsrO%2Fjg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./new-rouge-dior-lipstick-review.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>New Dior Rouge Lipstick Launch 2021</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./539063-katie-sepichs-story-what-happened-nmsu-graduate.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Katie Sepich's story: What really happened to the NMSU graduate?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./409878-100-summer-instagram-captions-sunny-funny-html.html>100+ summer Instagram captions that are sunny and funny</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-neck-cream.html>19 Best Neck Creams of 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./angelina-jolie-daughter-vivienne-resembles-brad-pitt-new-photo.html>Angelina Jolie's daughter Vivienne looks just like Brad Pitt in new photo from momentous outing toge</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chicagos-summer-smash-festival-signs-a-ticketing-deal-with-dice.html>Chicagos Summer Smash Festival Signs A Ticketing Deal With DICE</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./fosters-voice-reaching-his-peers-with-organization-of-school-club.html>Foster's Voice reaching his peers with organization of school club</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog.
