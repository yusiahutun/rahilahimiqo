There were hundreds of artworks drawn or painted by students of MiniDalton, Little Dalton Kindergarten, DSHK and partnering institutions, including Tsinghua University Primary School, Family Partner School, Shirley’s Art House, The Blue Gallery and FunDrawing.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“We first started Little Basel three years ago and it has really grown since then,” said DSHK founding principal Larry Leaven. “The festival is powerful because it allows students to show their work, which gives them a lot of self-confidence and belief. It demonstrates the power that art brings to students and what it represents in our overall curriculum.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/660x385/public/d8/images/2019/05/08/dshk_scmp_2.jpg>Leaven said that DSHK offers dance, vocal music, instrumental work, digital arts, and visual arts classes to students.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“One of my favourite things is when students actually say, ‘I am an artist’ or ‘I am a dancer’. When children believe something, they can do it. So, Little Basel is really an echo of what students believe in themselves.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Over 2,200 people attended Little Basel, which featured prestigious guests like Hong Kong actor Alex Fong. There were more than 25 live art workshop stations across a variety of creative genres like fine art, music, dance and theatre.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/660x385/public/d8/images/2019/05/08/dshk_scmp_3.jpg>From dance workshops hosted by the Hong Kong ballet, to Virtual Reality gaming studios by Dalton Learning Lab, the amount of impressive artwork on display seemed never-ending.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">This was all made possible thanks to the sheer size of the DSHK school space. According to Leaven - the campus – located in the West Kowloon Cultural District -originally a mix-use space was instead converted into what is probably the most impressive early-years learning space in the entire city.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">DSHK has seemingly unlimited state-of-the-art facilities, which include an indoor and covered play area, library and learning space, multiple drama/dance/music practice rooms; multiple science and robotics rooms; and a professional development centre.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">However, Leaven, who has over 30 years of education experience in both the US and the mainland, said that what makes DSHK special isn’t the campus or the facilities, but rather, the school’s unique educational philosophy.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“We don’t simply teach subjects out of a textbook – we focus on getting students to look at inquiry as a broader concept,” said Leaven. “For example, we recently had the students engage in a project on bridges, which required them to look at the scientific components, mathematical components, artistic components and everything else that might go into building a bridge.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/660x385/public/d8/images/2019/05/08/dshk_scmp_4.jpg>A big focus, Leaven says, is for teachers to put children in position to find answers to problems by themselves, and to abide by the school’s motto: “I am not led, I lead.”<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“For too long education has been about adults creating checklists and tests, rather than engaging with children and trusting them to decide what they believe in, and discover who they really are,” Leaven said. “We give them a vision for possibility and work with them to achieve individual learning goals.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Another thing that separates DSHK from other schools is its dual-language curriculum.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“We aren’t just a bilingual school, we are a dual-language school, which means we want all of our students to be able to speak, read and write in both English and Putonghua,” said Leaven, who added that DSHK tries to incorporate the strengths of both Eastern and Western teaching philosophies. “And we don’t just want them to be able to master the languages, but to honour different languages and cultures as well.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/660x385/public/d8/images/2019/05/08/dshk_scmp_5.jpg>Leaven said hiring teachers qualified to teach this curriculum is a “long and arduous process”.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“They can’t just be strong candidates, that is the bare minimum. They have to be willing to learn as well,” he said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The school is now accepting applications for playgroup up through primary. There is a kindergarten campus on Hong Kong Island known as Little Dalton Kindergarten, located in Pok Fu Lam, which Leaven describes as “intimate and cozy”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">DSHK is also looking to provide an all-through school for its students and, to that end, is working tirelessly with the Hong Kong Education Bureau to find a site for a secondary school. Although this has been a long and painstaking process, Leaven is optimistic that this will happen one day.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In addition, with more than 200 Dalton Schools worldwide, DSHK students will be introduced into one of the largest network of successful students in the entire world.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kvbOx0p6lrZ2UZLumw9Jon6iml2K4sLrGaJydrZOWwaq7zWirqKiZmMBwv8KhpqikXZa%2FtbXSrapomaKptqS4xGhqaWhpaIJze9Kcn6innGKus8DIrKus</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./best-hair-masks.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Best Hair Masks for Every Hair Type</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./neil-bonin.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Neil Bonin dating?
