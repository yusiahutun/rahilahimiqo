Speaking with Shepard -- <a href=#>who recently relapsed himself</a> -- she revealed how she started drinking again and when she realized she was in a bad place again.</p><p>"I was Miss Program. I love it, it was everything to me. It helped me grow up, it helped me figure out who I am," she said of AA. "When quarantine happened and the world changed, I started to change too. I started doing online meetings and I didn't like them. I got nothing out if it, they made me angry and resentful."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:a9b13792-a511-4c2f-8f5d-c400cc366875 data-container-ref=toofab:article:ee303468-0819-4586-87e7-6de50eaa1b0a data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/4a/5by4/2021/05/04/4a647fb404184ca98e66b8bc9f5a5ef0_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Kelly Osbourne Says She and Sister Aimee 'Don't Talk' to Each Other</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>Over time, she stopped calling her sponsor and all of her friends started relapsing too. While she thought she had succeeded by making it through the "worst part of lockdown" without a slip, her downward spiral actually began when everything started going "incredible" for her.</p><p>"I'm the girl that when things go incredible and everything is where you think it should be and you suddenly find yourself in what you think happiness is, I went, 'Oh, I'm normal now, I'm happy, I don't need any of this f---ing s--- anymore," she explained. "And then I sat by a pool by myself, I saw this girl drinking a glass of champagne and thought, I'll have one of them. And I just had one and it was fine and I had a great time."</p><p>"Then a couple weeks went by and thought, 'I did it then, I can do it again.' Two weeks later, done. F---ing done," she said. "Did not last long, did embarrassing s---, blacked out. It wasn't fun."</p><p>She clarified that she only drank and didn't take any pills -- because she's also on anti-depressants and worried mixing anything else with them could lead to death.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:92654af1-e731-4822-a1da-01ad21efa4b9 data-container-ref=toofab:article:ee303468-0819-4586-87e7-6de50eaa1b0a data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=29><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/0e/5by4/2021/04/23/0e8af27b73ad4720b97fa81703920d95_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">PodcastOne</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Kelly Osbourne Revealed Relapse for 'Accountability,' Hopes to 'Educate' with New Podcast (Exclusive)</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>"In my mind I was still in control," she continued. "It wasn't until I found myself last weekend covered in ranch dressing by my friend's pool sunburnt looking like a piece of s--- where I went maybe I don't have this under control."</p><p>Osbourne also said she plopped herself on the couch on that day to watch her boyfriend Erik Bragg work out while she was drunk -- and the look he gave her made her realize, "Okay, I'm done." She called up her sponsor, signed up for therapy and posted her Instagram video revealing her relapse after that.</p><p>During the candid convo, Shepard also recalled going to meetings at the Osbournes' home back in the day, when he too was on MTV. "I feel in love with both your mother and you in the process," said Dax, "I would come over to a meeting and flirt with you and your mother just shamelessly for a half hour."</p><p>"He would be like, 'You're gonna marry me when you grow up,'" Osbourne recalled.</p><p>Shepard also remembered thinking at the time how strange it was that addiction "escaped" Kelly, who said she was just "much better at hiding it" back in the day. "What I was doing, no one was looking at," she added, saying everyone was distracted by Jack's issues, her mother's cancer battle and her father's motorcycle accident.</p><p>Listen to the full conversation below:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3J7j25maWxfoLKtuNhmpqyan6q%2Fr7GMq5ylmaCosm6wwLFkrKCVpa6zsIysppuqmZrBuns%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./menulog-founder-dan-katz-splashes-20-million-sydney-waterfront-mansion-vaucluse-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Menulog founder Dan Katz splashes out on $20m Sydney waterfront mansion</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./fanum.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Fanum</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./409878-100-summer-instagram-captions-sunny-funny-html.html>100+ summer Instagram captions that are sunny and funny</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-neck-cream.html>19 Best Neck Creams of 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./angelina-jolie-daughter-vivienne-resembles-brad-pitt-new-photo.html>Angelina Jolie's daughter Vivienne looks just like Brad Pitt in new photo from momentous outing toge</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chicagos-summer-smash-festival-signs-a-ticketing-deal-with-dice.html>Chicagos Summer Smash Festival Signs A Ticketing Deal With DICE</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./fosters-voice-reaching-his-peers-with-organization-of-school-club.html>Foster's Voice reaching his peers with organization of school club</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog.
