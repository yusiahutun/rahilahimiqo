Despite her former husband Bill's allegations about her having affairs she has managed to smile and move on.</p><p>Let's find in detail about their divorce in detail. &nbsp;</p><h2>Maureen E. McPhilmy Divorced Former Husband Bill O'Reilly in 2011</h2><p>The successful host, journalist, syndicated columnist, and political commentator Bill O'Reilly was previously happily married to his lovely wife, Maureen McPhilmy, who worked as a public relations executive.</p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/img.marriedwiki.com/uploads/2017/01/after-divorcing-bill-o-reilly-maureen-e-mcphilmy-is-now-married-to-jeffrey-gross-find-maureen-e-mcphilmy-married-history.jpg alt width=450 height=281 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p><strong>Bill O'Reilly and Maureen McPhilmy finally divorced.</strong></p><p>The duo tied the knot on 2nd November 1996 organizing a grand wedding at St. Brigid Parish of Westbury. They seemed really happy together but who knew their happiness was not meant to last long.</p><p>After 15 years of marriage, the duo blessed with two children <strong>Madeline O'Reilly, 18</strong> and <strong>Spencer O'Reilly, 15</strong> started having fights and arguments and finally in 2010, Maureen filed for a divorce.</p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/img.marriedwiki.com/uploads/2017/01/28d6a6b900000578-0-image-m-551432153843740.jpg alt width=450 height=544 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p><strong>Maureen McPhilmy with ex-husband Bill O'Reilly.</strong></p><p><strong>Source: DailyMail</strong></p><p>The news came as a shock and even shocking were the reasons behind this tragedy. Maureen revealed that the major reason was that she was physically assaulted by Billy several times in front of their children.&nbsp;</p><h2>Bill O'Reilly Physically Assaulted His Former Wife Maureen E. McPhilmy And His $10 Million Lawsuit</h2><p>Amidst the rumors of their divorce, several sources<a href=# rel=noopener>&nbsp;</a>further claimed that the Fox News anchor Bill <a href=# rel=noopener>who was accused of sexual harassment by Reporter</a><a href=# rel=noopener> Juliet Huddy</a>&nbsp;and <a href=# rel=noopener>Andrea Tantaros</a> literally dragged Maureen down the staircase by her neck and manhandled her.</p><p>&nbsp;<img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedwiki.com/uploads/2017/04/maureen-e-mcphilmy.jpg alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p><strong>Bill O'Reilly with former wife Maureen E. McPhilmy</strong></p><p><strong>Source: Radar Online</strong></p><p>Not only that, Bill also made Maureen suffer a&nbsp;hard time while fighting for her children's custody accusing her of having an extra-marital affair during their married life.</p><p>The three-year custody dispute between O'Reilly and ex-wife Maureen McPhilmy finally ended last month when a Nassau County Supreme Court justice granted custody of the couple's two kids to their mother.</p><p>After the prolonged custody battle, O'Reilly filed a lawsuit against his ex-wife for having an extra affair when the two were still married. He asked that McPhilmy should pay him $10 million.</p><p>In legal papers, he claimed that McPhilmy 'made false representations and material omissions of existing fact ... for the sole purpose of inducing Plaintiff to agree to a consensual divorce and to obtain money and real property to finance an existing extra-marital relationship.'</p><p>The case was filed just a month later O'Reilly lost the custody battle. While he was accused of physical abuse dragging McPhilmy down the staircase in their home by her neck, he said that it is 100% false.</p><p>He stated,</p><p>'All allegations against me in these circumstances are 100 percent false. I am going to respect the court-mandated confidentiality put in place to protect my children and will not comment any further.'</p><h2>Maureen E. McPhilmy Happily Married To Detective Jeffrey Gross</h2><p>After divorcing her husband, Bill, Maureen moved on in her life along with two beautiful kids and eventually married Nassau County Police's detective,<strong> Jeffrey Gross</strong>.</p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/img.marriedwiki.com/uploads/2017/01/3494f08400000578-0-image-a-51464182777348.jpg alt width=449 height=674 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p><strong>Jeffrey Gross.</strong></p><p><strong>Source: Facebook</strong></p><p>Gawker claimed that Bill once went on a rampage to ruin the career of Jeffrey just out of anger. Also, he even made an attempt to dismember Maureen out from the Catholic Church.</p><p>Seems like Bill has declared a war against the couple!</p><p>Here's a video of "Killing Patton" author Bill O'Reilly talking on The Daily Show.</p><p></p><p>Currently, Maureen and her husband Jeffrey is staying in upscale Manhasset, New York in their beautiful house along with their children.</p><p>Well, all in all, we really hope that Bill stops making false accusations about his ex-wife and soon make peace with her and move on with his life too.</p><h2><strong>Maureen E.
