Technology Group started research on lithography systems last month, according to people familiar with the matter, as China’s home-grown semiconductor tool makers try workarounds to produce advanced chips without the latest equipment from Dutch giant ASML, a breakthrough that could potentially thwart US attempts to contain China’s chip-making capabilities.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The efforts, which involve multiple players in China’s semiconductor supply chain, have made preliminary research progress, with a patent application by Huawei Technologies last month revealing a technique known as self-aligned quadruple patterning, or SAQP, which can etch lines on silicon wafers multiple times to increase transistor density and chip performance.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The patent, which combines advanced etching and lithography, “will increase the design freedom of circuit patterns”, according to a filing to the China National Intellectual Property Administration, which was first reported by Bloomberg.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">By using SAQP with deep ultraviolet lithography (DUV) machines from Dutch giant ASML and Japanese suppliers like Nikon, China could make sophisticated 5-nanometre grade chips without the need for more advanced extreme ultraviolet (EUV) tools only available from ASML.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0

Chinese firm SMIC’s Huawei chip ‘potentially’ broke American law</span></p></a></h3>Chinese President Xi Jinping told visiting <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte</span></a> in Beijing last week that “no force can stop the pace of China’s scientific and technological development and progress”, while Chinese commerce minister Wang Wentao told his Dutch counterpart Geoffrey van Leeuwen that the Netherlands should fulfil “contractual obligations” and ensure “normal” trade of lithography machines.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Meanwhile, China’s decade-long effort to develop its own lithography machines has hit a wall. The state-owned Shanghai Micro Electronics Equipment Group (SMEE), the country’s sole lithography systems maker, has not come anywhere close to developing machines that match ASML. In December 2022, SMEE was added to a US trade blacklist over national security concerns, meaning it is even less likely to achieve a breakthrough.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/04/01/d0ccafbe-989c-44ad-91c8-fed97dff5abc_c1de32d4.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">A number of Chinese chip tool makers have emerged as important players in efforts to cut the country’s reliance on imported machines. Local semiconductor equipment leader Naura Technology Group has conducted preliminary research into lithography systems since March after it established a special programme last December, according to sources familiar with the matter.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The company has told a small group of engineers to begin research on lithography systems, which is beyond its traditional expertise in etching and film deposition, according to the people, who declined to be named because the discussions were private.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">A spokesman for Naura told the Post on Monday the information was not “true”, without elaborating.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">While it is far from certain that Naura’s new research efforts will pay off, the move shows the determination by the country’s chip industry to break US-orchestrated sanctions aimed at curbing China’s advances in semiconductors and artificial intelligence.</p>Meanwhile, these efforts are being conducted in absolute secrecy to avoid further sanctions from Washington, which views them as skirting existing export controls. The US government is considering blacklisting a number of Chinese <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">semiconductor</span></a> firms linked to <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Huawei Technologies</span></a> after the Shenzhen-based tech giant achieved a noticeable breakthrough in advanced chips, Bloomberg reported last month. One of the potential targets is SiCarrier, a state-backed chip tool developer that works with Huawei, and was granted a patent related to SAQP late last year.<h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">China ‘needs to focus on boosting domestic AI sector to close gap on US’</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The involvement of Chinese firms across the chip tool supply chain is to be expected, as Beijing is pulling resources from all fronts to achieve breakthroughs, analysts said. Dan Hutcheson, vice-chairman of US-based IC research company TechInsights, said China’s SAQP research is likely to involve companies like Naura and SMEE, as etching and deposition expertise was required for lithography.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“It is driven by SiCarrier’s SAQP patent, which replaces optical lithography steps with etch and deposition steps and will help China get to 5-nm,” Hutcheson said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Shenzhen-based SiCarrier was granted a similar patent by China’s intellectual property authority in December 2023, in which it describes a method to use DUV tools and SAQP to achieve 5-nm node production, according to its filing.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/04/01/ed72d63a-ae01-4dfb-869a-1f2928cb59dc_94c9c07d.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Separately, a research memo by Citigroup analysts claimed that Naura and local rival Advanced Micro-Fabrication Equipment were looking into complementary efforts on a new multiple-patterning technology that uses etching techniques to achieve 7-nm and more advanced chips, according to a Bloomberg report.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">To be sure, achieving 7-nm, or even 5-nm grade chips, will still mean China is behind the state of the art. Global foundry leader Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co produced 3-nm chips for Apple last year, and is scheduled to advance to 2-nm silicon enabled by ASML’s latest EUV machines.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">But few are willing to bet against China when Beijing has the ability to mobilise the country’s entire semiconductor supply chain. By the end of 2023, Naura had applied for more than 7,900 patents, and had obtained rights to more than 4,600 of those, according to company stock filing in February.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kwaavx2irnpuYYsSivo6aqa2hk6GycH%2BRbm5tbGJkwaavx2aumqpdmLWqusBmqK6hlam5unnMmqKippdivbO7xqucrKtdo7K4edOemqGmmabCpr%2BMnKytZaKauaqtzZycZpmUq66vr8SdZJqrnaF6rbXToaagqpGltbo%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./steve-lacy.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Real Name of Steve Lacy, Bio, Age, Net Worth, GF, Height, Albums</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./deacon-hill-benched-after-3-turnovers-as-hawkeyes-blanked-at-citrus-bowl.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Deacon Hill benched after 3 turnovers as Hawkeyes blanked at Citrus Bowl</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./409878-100-summer-instagram-captions-sunny-funny-html.html>100+ summer Instagram captions that are sunny and funny</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-neck-cream.html>19 Best Neck Creams of 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./angelina-jolie-daughter-vivienne-resembles-brad-pitt-new-photo.html>Angelina Jolie's daughter Vivienne looks just like Brad Pitt in new photo from momentous outing toge</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chicagos-summer-smash-festival-signs-a-ticketing-deal-with-dice.html>Chicagos Summer Smash Festival Signs A Ticketing Deal With DICE</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./fosters-voice-reaching-his-peers-with-organization-of-school-club.html>Foster's Voice reaching his peers with organization of school club</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog.
