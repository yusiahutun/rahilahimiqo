I can't deny that."</p><p>"You have two very alpha-driven people. You get two, there can only be one," he added.</p><p>Diesel -- who stars as Dominic Toretto in the action film franchise -- has, of course, starred in all 10 (and counting) Fast & Furious installments. Meanwhile, Johnson and his Fast & Furious character, Luke Hobbs, first appeared in 2011's Fast Five. He went on to reprise his role in Fast & Furious 6 (2013), Furious 7 (2015) and The Fate of the Furious (2017), before starring in the 2019 spinoff film, Hobbs & Shaw. He also made a surprise appearance in a post-credits scene of Fast X.</p><p>As it's now known, a feud was <a href=#><strong>brewing </strong></a>between Johnson and Diesel behind the scenes of the films. The former reportedly only agreed to star in the eighth film, The Fate of the Furious, if he didn't have to shoot any scenes with Diesel. Johnson told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Vanity Fair</strong></a> in 2021 that he "wanted to forgo drama," saying that he believed the decision "was the best thing to do" at the time.</p><p>But toward the end of the shoot for The Fate of the Furious in 2016, Johnson went on to famously blast at least one of his costars as "chicken s--t" and "candy asses" in a <a href=#><strong>scathing social media post</strong></a>, which he later deleted.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:72c415ab-daea-4241-bd37-8d4b78316991 data-container-ref=toofab:article:7aecf84e-9ad8-4047-a75f-1e4a26d91326 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/de/5by4/2023/10/09/de8d17f3e0c64852b337c723532ec1ca_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">John Cena Opens Up About His Feud with Dwayne Johnson: 'I Went About It The Wrong Way'</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>"A candy ass is something you don't want to be," the Jumani star told Vanity Fair while opening up about the drama. "And the best way that I can describe a candy ass is: Life is so much easier, I have found, when you are not full of s--t. And a candy ass is completely full of s--t."</p><p>As for why he shared the Instagram post at the time, Johnson said, "Nothing specific happened, just the same old s---. And that just wasn't my best day." While he said that he "meant" what he wrote, Johnson admitted that to "express it publicly was not the right thing to do."</p><p>Diesel, for his part, has shared his thoughts on his relationship with Johnson in the past. At one point, per Vanity Fair, the actor expressed that Johnson "has he only has one big brother in the film world, and that's me."</p><p>"I have one big brother and it's my half brother. And that's it," Johnson told the outlet in response to that quote specifically.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Hope you‚Äôve got your funderwear on‚Ä¶</p><p>HOBBS IS BACK.<br>And he just got lei‚Äôd üå∫üòà</p><p>Luke Hobbs will be returning to the Fast & Furious franchise.</p><p>Your reactions around the world to Hobbs‚Äô return in Fast X have blown us away ü§Øüôèüèæüåç</p><p>The next Fast & Furious film you‚Äôll see the‚Ä¶ <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/vvtBgTBOnl</a></p>‚Äî Dwayne Johnson (@TheRock) <a href=#>June 1, 2023</a> <a href=# rel=noopener>@TheRock</a><p>Now, years later, it appears that the two have since squashed their beef as Johnson is returning to the Fast & Furious franchise.

The Rock <a href=#><strong>shared a video </strong></a>on X, formerly Twitter, in which he explained that he and Diesel have been like brothers for a long time, and their resolution was inevitable.</p><p>"Despite us having our differences, me and Vin, we've been like brothers for years," he explained.

That's rarified air," Cena told Shepard. "At the very least, there has to be respect for that. And I think when you look at it from that perspective, and I also know I'm a guest. I'm not trying to get into the sandbox. That's not my thing. I'm grateful for what you've given me.
