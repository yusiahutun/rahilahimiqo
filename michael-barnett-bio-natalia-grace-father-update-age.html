How old is he? Where is he now?</p><h3><strong>Meet Michael Barnett, Natalia Grace Father</strong></h3><p>Indianapolis native Michael Barnett, a father of three, adopted a 6-year-old Ukrainian orphan named Natalia Grace in April 2010. Natalia’s birth certificate from Ukraine said that she was 7 years old at the time, but according to data from the Peyton Manning Children’s Hospital in Indianapolis, she was actually closer to 8 years old. But the Barnetts soon realized they were probably wrong about their first assumptions about her age.</p><p>The Daily Mail claims that they started to think Grace was really an adult disguising herself as a child. They said Grace had menstrual periods and other signs of puberty. Following suit shortly after, the Barnetts claimed Grace was attempting to kill them.</p><p>“Natalia would do things like place clear thumbtacks on the stairs face up so that when we would walk up the stairs, we would be stepping on thumbtacks to pain and injure ourselves,” Michael Barnett said on Good Morning America in 2019. Natalia and the Barnetts were eventually unable to live together anymore.</p><p>Shreceived surgery in August 2010 for club foot, a birth defect in which feet are twisted or misshapen, Starbuck said. When Natalia’s adoptive parents didn’t pick her up from the hospital, the hospital placed her in what Starbucks described as a “halfway house.” Her parents didn’t like that, she said, so Natalia was placed in an apartment in Westfield, Indiana, where Michael Barnett would regularly check on her and bring her food. He also paid her rent.</p><p>Natalia was moved to a Lafayette apartment in July 2013, and her parents, along with their three sons. As a result, Natalia was left in a rental property in Lafayette, Indiana when Michael, Kristine, and their biological children emigrated to Canada in 2013 in less than 30 days. When it was discovered Natalia was living alone in an apartment in Lafayette, Indiana in 2013, the parents of the young girl found themselves in hot water. This prompted an inquiry and their arrests.</p><p>The Barnetts were charged with abandoning their daughter. On September 18 and September 19, 1019, respectively, Michael and Kristine Barnett turned themselves in at the Tippecanoe County Jail pursuant to arrest warrants. Michael posted a $5,000 surety bond and a $500 cash bond and was freed.</p><p>Michael and <a href=#>Kristine</a> eventually got divorced. According to Kristine, in a court declaration, Michael returned to Indiana in the fall of 2013 “after an incident impacting the children.” There is no description of that occurrence in the divorce filings. Records from the divorce indicate that Michael never went back to live with the family.</p><p>The divorce filings also reveal that in 2014, Kristine engaged in negotiations for the film rights to “The Spark,” her book on Jacob’s diagnosis with autism and the subsequent discovery of his intellectual abilities.</p><p>But they continued to make accusations against Natalia for years afterward.</p><p>The ex-spouses initially petitioned the Marion County Probate Court in 2012 to change Natalia’s birth year from 2003 to 1989. Per&nbsp;The Washington Post,&nbsp;Michael further alleged that his ex-wife coached their adopted daughter, too, to tell people that she was 22 years old if they asked. B<span>ut, in September 2019, the state of Indiana charged the couple with numerous counts of maltreatment.</span></p><h3><strong>Michael Barnett Update: Where Is He Today?</strong></h3><p>Michael Barnett was charged with counts of conspiracy to neglect a dependent, neglect of a dependent causing significant bodily damage, negligence of a dependent causing bodily injury, and neglect of a dependent causing bodily injury. However, in February 2022, four charges of neglecting a dependant were dropped against him.</p><p>Less than six months after Michael Barnett’s charges were dropped, Kristine’s were dropped as well in March 2023.</p><p>“We were all abused,” Michael screams in the trailer for the teaser of a recent documentary on Investigation Discovery. “I hate this.”</p><p>“She tried to poison and kill my wife,” Michael said in the trailer for the documentary, The Curious Case Of Natalia Grace. “One night, I opened my eyes and Natalia is standing at the foot of the bed with a knife in her hand.”</p><h3><strong>Michael Barnett Age</strong></h3><p>Michael Barnett’s birth year is 1976.
