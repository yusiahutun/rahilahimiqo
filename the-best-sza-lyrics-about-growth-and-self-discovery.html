We get so lonely, we pretend that this works." These lyrics beautifully portray the emotional turmoil that comes with self-discovery. They highlight the struggle of maintaining self-love and worth when faced with the challenges of love and self-doubt, ultimately emphasizing the importance of personal growth in finding inner strength.SZA's lyrical prowess is further exemplified in "20 Something," a heartfelt ballad that encapsulates the uncertainties and self-reflection faced during one's twenties.

Let your edge out, too soon I spoke." These powerful words encapsulate SZA's commitment to stepping outside her comfort zone, embracing her true self, and experiencing personal development and growth.
