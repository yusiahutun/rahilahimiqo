My actual crime? The reason for these spiteful comments? Wearing a see-through lace dress with a visible thong on my wedding day.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Here’s a bit of context, because you probably don’t know me from Eve (shout-out to my spiritual sister, the OG naked dresser responsible for the fall of mankind). I got married at Christmas 2021 in Paris, to a great guy who has never once asked me, “You’re not going out in that are you?” We snuck our wedding in just before the world closed down for the millionth time. Because this was an indoor winter affair, happening as Omicron was beginning to show its ugly face, older family members and loved ones told us early on that they could not be part of our special day. My consolation prize was to up the ante outfit-wise, knowing there would be fewer sensitive eyebrows raised on the night.</p><img alt="camille charriere wedding" title="Camille Charriere wedding" width=3130 height=2075 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/camille-charriere-1646659068.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Maxime Ballesteros</span><p>Camille Charriere with her husband on their wedding day in December 2021</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">I did not choose the dress, the dress chose me. A Harris Reed lace slip, delicate and timeless. It didn’t look racy when I first saw it in The New Yorker, but things rarely do in editorial shoots. I was not intentionally out to shock, but I could never picture myself as a conventional bride. And our wedding reflected that: I refused to be given away. We didn’t do a first dance, and I had no desire to wear a traditional, virginal gown. My risqué dress supported my stance on the matter. Fashion is, after all, a form of communication and my dress, in all its defiantly sheer, sexy glory, spoke of who I am and what I believe in.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">It’s important for me to state at this point that I would never judge anyone who believes in and wants a traditional wedding, and wants to wear the full white shebang. It is, quite simply, not my place to decide what any woman should or should not wear. In fact, I deeply resent the way our wardrobes are still being policed by society. We, collectively, should feel furious that women still have to endure this patriarchal nonsense.</p><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span>"Why is it that my short skirt still makes you feel uneasy?"<span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">What the scathing reaction to my wedding dress indicated was how rife internalised misogyny still is; the idea that women subconsciously project sexist ideas onto other women, and even onto themselves. It’s caused by deeply entrenched, abstract ideas about how women should dress and behave — standards created by a patriarchal society. Whether we realise it or not, some of us end up drinking this stuff in to such a level that we project this sexism onto other women.</p><h6 class="css-ok56rr e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related Story</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">I grew up in France, the land of sartorial judginess, where internalised misogyny is endemic. It’s easier to dress ‘safe’; nothing too short or too sexy, to avoid being ostracised by your peers (the women especially). Without sounding dramatic, it’s one of the reasons I moved to London in the first place. I couldn’t stand the way people — from every sex, old and young, strangers and friends — quite literally pointed the finger at women who wore anything ‘inappropriate’. It involves a gross combo of classism (“it’s not chic”) and gender discrimination (“she asked for it”). The women before us fought hard for our sexual liberation in the '60s and '70s, so why is it that my short skirt still makes you feel uneasy?</p><h2 data-node-id=12 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60">“Hideous and tacky.”</h2><h2 data-node-id=13 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60">“Incredibly vulgar, nothing new about this.”</h2><h2 data-node-id=14 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60">“She will regret it; she missed out on wearing a dress of grace, beauty and innocence.”</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The problem with sexism is that we can’t win. Too covered up? Boring. Too naked? Slut. And my issue with letting people get away with nasty comments like these? Certainly not because I’ve lost sleep over what a few unhappy strangers thought about my wedding dress (please let the record state: I am beyond honoured to have been Harris’ first fluid bride). My concern is the ease with which we spread hate, and where that might lead. The defences of this bile are always the same — “I am just using my freedom of speech” and, “You put yourself in the public eye”.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Let there be no mistake — this isn’t an issue restricted to fashion alone. It exists every time we criticise a woman for being “too emotional” or “too sensitive”, when we undermine the intellectual value of women’s literature, or when we question why a woman didn’t come forward with a sexual assault allegation sooner. Internalised misogyny is at work when we, as women, put up with male behaviour that we shouldn’t have to put up with. Every time a woman says “I’m not like other girls”, she does so because she’s terrified of being seen as weak, incapable or unappealing because of her femininity. Whenever we display a deep aversion to anything feminine — from hating on the colour pink because it’s ‘girly’, or refusing to cook because it was traditionally a female duty — we are falling victim to a patriarchal structure that’s been thrust on us for centuries.</p><img alt="camille charriere wedding" title="Camille Charriere " width=1124 height=1698 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/c09bbceb-936d-4601-b65c-394558c60b94-jpg-1646667938.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Maxime Ballesteros</span><p>Charriere in her Harris Reed dress and vintage Galliano coat</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The patriarchy has trained us to feel bad about ourselves, to believe that we are not enough, and to compare ourselves to other women.

We look at the women around us and we compare. Are we alike? Are we superior? Are we inferior? There is a terrible solidarity to this given that almost no woman can avoid it.”</p><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span>"We have all absorbed so much misogyny over the course of our lives that sometimes, it spills out"<span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The beginning of wisdom is calling something by its proper name; misogyny is not an opinion. So why not try this: the next time you feel like sharing something spiteful online or on your girlfriend WhatsApp group, remember that you are betraying yourself just as much as the woman you’re tearing down. I know I may sit on the extreme side of the fence when it comes to sartorial freedom, but if I may make a suggestion on the one day that is marked in the calendar to talk about these things – perhaps it’s time that we really considered why we feel the need to criticise other women. We have all absorbed so much misogyny over the course of our lives that sometimes, it spills out in ugly ways. What I do with my body, is my choice. Just like what you do with yours, on your wedding day, when you are pregnant, or just out and about, is yours. Don’t let anyone tell you otherwise.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">This piece was originally published in March 2022</p><h6 class="css-ok56rr e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related Story</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qa3RqZyrq5KWx6Kt0WeaqKVfqrhwr9Slq66qlWSudIWSbXBsbmdksKK5yKWjnmWTna6zvsieqZ5llpq6orjEZqSiq5%2Bcxq%2FFjg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./430852-120-funny-comments-girls-instagram-laugh.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>120+ funny comments for girls on Instagram to make her laugh</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./that-girl-lay-lay.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>That Girl Lay Lay - Bio, Age, Net Worth, Nationality, Single, Facts</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./409878-100-summer-instagram-captions-sunny-funny-html.html>100+ summer Instagram captions that are sunny and funny</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-neck-cream.html>19 Best Neck Creams of 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./angelina-jolie-daughter-vivienne-resembles-brad-pitt-new-photo.html>Angelina Jolie's daughter Vivienne looks just like Brad Pitt in new photo from momentous outing toge</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chicagos-summer-smash-festival-signs-a-ticketing-deal-with-dice.html>Chicagos Summer Smash Festival Signs A Ticketing Deal With DICE</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./fosters-voice-reaching-his-peers-with-organization-of-school-club.html>Foster's Voice reaching his peers with organization of school club</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog.
