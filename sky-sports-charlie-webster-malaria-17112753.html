I was told I probably wouldn’t.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article16595721.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_5cade69881682_CharlieWebster> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article16595713.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_1607945><p>Charlie fell ill after an epic 3,000-mile charity biking trip from London to the Olympic Games in Rio back in 2016.</p><p>At first she thought she was simply suffering from exhaustion, but soon she had started bleeding uncontrollably and her organs began to shut down.</p><p>Charlie was put into an induced coma and at one point hospital doctors feared she might not survive the night.</p><p>She says: “When I did survive I had to learn to walk again. I couldn’t even do the simplest of tasks.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article16595714.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_1607949><p>“I’m getting better but I still see consultants a lot and have my organs and blood counts checked.</p><p>“I have lasting damage that was caused from being on life support and in a coma and an ongoing kidney problem. Scans of my kidneys look like they have been in a war.</p><p>“There’s loads of scar tissue that won’t regenerate. They won’t improve and I have a bit of a liver thing going on too.</p><p>“So I have to be careful with dehydration. I drink litres of water a day. I feel sick straightaway if I do get dehydrated.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article16595718.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_1607960><p>Charlie, who once dated Downton Abbey’s Allen Leech, has had to go teetotal too: “I’ve not been able to drink any alcohol since.</p><p>“I don’t think I’d die if I had a drink but I think it would make me really ill. You could give me a million pounds now and I wouldn’t have a drink.</p><p>“I haven’t found it hard to give up other than in social situations. I’m single and in this country the thing is to go for a drink. I can’t have sugary drinks either, so it is a bit odd when I just order a glass of water when I’m going on a date.</p><p>“I went clubbing and ordered a cup of tea at 3am in the morning!”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article16595715.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_1607952><p>There are lots of other issues that Charlie has been left with.</p><p>She says: “I’ve had to re-learn everything, a different way of eating.</p><p>“I’m not supposed to eat much salt. If I have eaten salt I start to swell up – my legs, hands and face.</p><p>“I can’t take anti-inflammatories because my kidneys cannot process them. Because of the superbug I had I can take antibiotics, which means I have to be careful not to get injured.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article16595716.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_1607956><p>“I have had problems with my memory too. When I was in hospital a friend came in to see me and I couldn’t remember the word for sandwich – I couldn’t think what the name was for something with bread and ham. It was quite upsetting. I knew what the word was but couldn’t say it.”</p><p>Despite all the physical and mental challenges she’s faced Charlie was determined to get fit.</p><p>She says: “I want to see what I can achieve, to show people what you can come back from. I didn’t survive not to do things!”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article16595720.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_1608043><p>Charlie completed the 2018 London Marathon in aid of the charity Malaria No&nbsp;More UK and is now ready to compete in this year’s event. She says: “It means something special to me – I nearly lost my life. Not in a million years did I think I would go out running again.”</p><p>Charlie has concentrated on building up her overall body strength, rather than simply “smashing out” the miles in training.</p><p>She says: “I’m not doing as many miles as I would have done before as I’m not 100% and I do get tired. I mix it up – I do a lot of strength work and boxing really helps my confidence. I’m doing some secret 10ks and building strength in my legs from running up hills.”</p><p>When it comes to her diet, Charlie will usually eat eggs on toast with veg for breakfast or her own granola out of nuts and seeds with Greek yoghurt with honey. She typically snacks on fruit, has a Greek salad, rice or chicken for lunch and fish curry for dinner.</p><p>She says: “I can’t do plain food – I lost my tastebuds.”</p><p>And for a guilty pleasure?</p><p>She says: “I used to like Kettle Chips or salted popcorn, but I can’t do those any more, so I’ll have carrot cake, Bakewell tart or apple crumble. And I can’t cope without a cup of tea.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article16595719.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_1607965><p>Before the marathon Charlie will fuel up with a cuppa and have some toast and porridge.</p><p>But she says: “I’m not doing it for a time. Before, I would watch the clock and put pressure on myself, but now I couldn’t care less given the situation I was in two and a half years ago and came through.</p><p>“I thought my life was over. I’m discovering who I am again and that I can still do the things I did before.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article16595717.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_1607958><p>Charlie is passionate about raising funds to tackle malaria too, the mosquito-borne disease which kills nearly half a million people worldwide annually.</p><p>She adds: “Malaria is one of the biggest health challenges facing the world and we should help internationally. I don’t have malaria any more, but if I did get it again I probably wouldn’t survive.</p><p>“I’m on a second life. I need to live it the best I can.”</p><p>• To help Charlie beat malaria visit&nbsp;www.justgiving.com/fundraising/charliewebstermalaria</p><p>To find out more visit&nbsp;Malarianomore.org.uk</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCsrJGne6S7ja6iaKuYpMSjtdloqqSxXai9sL7TrGScoJGnuaqxjLCcm6ukmr9uucClmKuhkWJ%2BeH2Qa25uaw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./galesburg-offers-public-transportation-survey.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Galesburg offers public transportation survey</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./the-chicest-outerwear-for-anywhere.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>4 Timeless Coats to Wear This Winter</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./409878-100-summer-instagram-captions-sunny-funny-html.html>100+ summer Instagram captions that are sunny and funny</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-neck-cream.html>19 Best Neck Creams of 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./angelina-jolie-daughter-vivienne-resembles-brad-pitt-new-photo.html>Angelina Jolie's daughter Vivienne looks just like Brad Pitt in new photo from momentous outing toge</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chicagos-summer-smash-festival-signs-a-ticketing-deal-with-dice.html>Chicagos Summer Smash Festival Signs A Ticketing Deal With DICE</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./fosters-voice-reaching-his-peers-with-organization-of-school-club.html>Foster's Voice reaching his peers with organization of school club</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog.
