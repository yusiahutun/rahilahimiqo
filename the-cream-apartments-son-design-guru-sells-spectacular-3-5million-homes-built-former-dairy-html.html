of Britain’s most iconic institutions, including the Garrick Club and Mayfair’s Connaught Hotel.</span></p><p><span>As well as being involved in such prestigious projects, Christopher, a past president&nbsp; of the British Institute of Interior Design, also made his own furniture.</span></p><p><span>In 1979, needing a studio to produce his pieces, he bought a former Unigate dairy&nbsp; in North Kensington, a stone’s-throw from&nbsp; Ladbroke Grove and the fashionable Portobello Road market, for £90,000 and set up his own workshop.</span></p><img id=i-a84b0e65

not one, but two, flats in the old dairy in Kensington</p><p><span>It proved to be an astute buy. In 1995, Christopher no longer needed the workspace (partly because most of his one-off pieces were being copied), so he sold a portion of&nbsp; the land for development and then spent £2million converting the dairy into seven live/work units and a maisonette.</span></p><p><span>He gave three properties to his children – and today his son Maxim is selling a three-bedroom, two-storey apartment, which comes complete with a roof terrace, and a one-bedroom flat for a total of £3.5million.</span></p><p><span>The cul-de-sac in which the apartments are set contains a mixture of Victorian terrace houses and businesses – the old post office sorting office has since been converted into offices and studios, and an undertaker’s remains where it has been since 1937.<br></span></p><p><span>The three-bedroom apartment is, naturally, beautifully designed, although elegantly simple and retains its industrial character.</span></p><p><span>Maxim, a director of a property business that manages the £4.5billion Berkeley Square Estate in Central London, bought the top&nbsp; floor, which had been a studio, from his sister Tryce, and set about amalgamating it with&nbsp; the flat below.</span></p><img id=i-a9470e65 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/04/19/article-2608444-1D32472E00000578-860_634x460.jpg height=460 width=634 alt="Family flats: Maxim's father, designer Christopher Vane Percy, bought the ex-Unigate dairy in 1979 and converted it into flats and studios in 1995" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Family flats: Maxim's father, designer Christopher Vane Percy, bought the ex-Unigate dairy in 1979 and converted it into flats and studios in 1995</p><p><span>‘Because we owned the building we didn’t have to do all the work at once,’ says Maxim – the couple finished the top-floor kitchen and sitting room only two years ago. But their hard work was worth the wait, and the result is a stunning loft-like space with a vaulted ceiling and a vast skylight that floods the room with light.</span></p><p><span>‘We never put the lights on,’ says Maxim’s wife Lisette, 35, who runs a fashion business, pretaportobello.com, which showcases the couture of stallholders at Portobello and London markets. The open-plan room also gives a view of the campanile at nearby St Charles Hospital.</span></p><p><span>‘When my father bought the dairy it wasn’t listed, so he could have flattened it, but because he has a great interest in architecture he treated it like a listed building,’ says Maxim. ‘This part was the offices and&nbsp; all he did was gentrify it.’</span></p><p><span>But not by much. The beauty of the apartment is that it has space, light and an impressive utility.</span></p><p><span>The walls are hung with modern art – a Banksy, a Miranda Donovan and an intriguing work by James Hart Dyke, who followed MI6 spooks for a year, painting their interviews with contacts for a project to mark the 50th anniversary of James Bond.</span></p><p><span>A huge marble worktop in the kitchen reflects the building’s heritage. ‘In a dairy they would have used marble not because it’s easy to clean but because it’s cool,’ says Maxim.</span></p><img id=i-a8b50e62 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/04/19/article-2608444-1D3246A200000578-119_634x456.jpg height=456 width=634 alt="Mr Vane Percy is selling a three-bedroom, two-storey apartment, which comes complete with a roof terrace, and a one-bedroom flat for a total of £3.5million" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Mr Vane Percy is selling a three-bedroom, two-storey apartment, which comes complete with a roof terrace, and a one-bedroom flat for a total of £3.5million</p><img id=i-a7d60e5d src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/04/19/article-2608444-1D32477000000578-454_634x496.jpg height=496 width=634 alt="The Vane Percys in the kitchen in the three-bedroom flat in the old diary, located in North Kensington, London" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>The Vane Percys in the kitchen in the three-bedroom flat in the old diary, located in North Kensington, London</p><p><span>Brickwork beside the staircase is exposed, and the electric wiring is covered by aluminium scavenged from a decommissioned ship in India, while the huge pendant lights from the high ceiling in the hall came from a Vauxhall car factory.</span></p><p><span>Light and space are the key to this building – even the cloakroom has a view (out but not in) and the cupboards are designed to provide storage, but not at the expense of masking light or interrupting the flat’s flow.</span></p><p><span>The kitchen/reception is 32ft long and even the couple’s dressing room is the size of most double bedrooms.</span></p><p><span>‘We could have crammed in another bedroom but, for me, circulation space is so important,’ says Maxim, who points out&nbsp; that, with the flat below their apartment being part of the sale, the two could be knocked together into a house. Alternatively, the smaller flat could be kept as an investment opportunity.</span></p><p><span>So why sell? ‘We’re a young family and&nbsp; we want more children. The roof terrace is great but it’s not a garden,’ says Lisette.</span></p><p><span>Although Maxim admits that he’s not artistic, he made one key decision that has had a great impact on the property’s value.</span></p><p><span>‘When Dad developed the dairy, he did live/work units, but the problem is that it’s&nbsp; not great for residential values, so we changed its status&nbsp; to residential.</span></p><p><span>‘Not only is it very hard to get a mortgage on part-commercial and residential property, but you also have to pay business rates, which are expensive,’ he says.</span></p><p><span style=font-style:italic><span>Crayson, 020 7221 1117</span></span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCmmZmhe6S7ja6iaKaVrMBwrdGtoJyklWJ%2Fd3yXbWttZ4Sdsm6v0Z6YpmWRpa6zwMyepa2rXYi8r3nDnqqin55itLa%2B1GaqnqScqHq0vMScq5qbpaGus3mSZmymoZyhtrC6jKGmpp2jYq%2B2tcutZJ%2BnoqKys3nDmqCrsV6dwa64</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./who-is-tiger-woods-son-charlie-axel-woods-1281068.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Tiger Woods' Son?
