The show is created by comedian and musician Alex Horne, who also hosts the series with comedian Greg Davies. Along with hosting Taskmaster, Horne serves as the umpire for each challenge, while Davies judges the performances and awards points on how well the contestants do. The concept for Taskmasters was first created by Horne at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe in 2010 before he secured a deal with Davies to adapt it for television. The show won the British Academy Television Award for Best Comedy and Comedy Entertainment Programme in 2020.</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Outlander.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Outlander.jpg><p>In an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Channel 4</a> in 2020, Horne revealed how the idea for Taskmaster came to him. “Eleven years ago, my wife and I had had a baby, so I didn’t go to Edinburgh Fringe for the first time in years,” he said. “Tim Key won the comedy award and I was sat at home with the baby feeling very jealous, genuinely. So, I set up a show for the following year and I invited 20 comics. I sent them all emails secretly, didn’t tell them who each other was, and said, ‘I’m starting a new competition which you can enter, I’m going to set you a different task every month.’ Mike Wozniak won it and Tim didn’t, so I was happy. And none of the comedians was Greg Davies.”</p><p>He also confessed that he didn’t expect the show to be as popular as it is now and run for more than a dozen. “It was on at midnight and only 150 people watched it but it got more word of mouth than it probably merited. It was one of those quirky Edinburgh things. So we did it again the following year, then Avalon said, ‘There’s something in this’, and we started pitching it as a <a href=# id=auto-tag_tv data-tag=tv>TV</a> show with Greg hosting,” he said. Horne also opened up about how he chose Davies as his co-host. “Well, I would challenge you to name anyone else who could do that job. He had all the elements that role needed, as well as being very funny and good off the cuff. I’d say his physical attributes lend itself to the role, but also the headmasterly qualities,” he said.</p><p>So where can Americans stream Taskmaster?

Taskmaster is available to stream on Channel 4’s website, which has both current and past seasons. To watch the show in the US, however, Americans will need a VPN (virtual private network), a service that allows users to set their computer’s location to another country and access websites that would otherwise be restricted by location. The most popular VPNs are <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>ExpressVPN</a>, <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>NordVPN</a>, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">AtlasVPN</a>, and <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>Pure VPN</a>, all of which offer a 30-day-money-back guarantee.

The service—which allows users to set their location to more than 160 locations in 90 countries with unlimited bandwidth—offers a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">30-day-money-back guarantee</a>. ExpressVPN also has a current deal where users can subscribe for <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">$6.67 per month</a> with three months free for 12 months.
