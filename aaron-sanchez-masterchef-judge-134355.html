Being able to take the whole journey with them from start to finish is really rewarding because I get to see their growth as cooks.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/aaron-sanchez-masterchef-0.jpg><p>MasterChef judges Gordon, Aáron, and Christina.</p><h2>Why did you want to join the show as a judge?</h2><p>I wanted to join the show so that I can share my culture and be an example for young Latin Americans. I’m incredibly passionate about honoring my legacy and giving the next generation of aspiring chefs the necessary tools and resources for success.</p><h2>Which other judge are you most eager to work with?</h2><p>Both Christina and Gordon are really amazing to work with. Gordon is really becoming a mentor and a source of inspiration to me, which is awesome to have at my stage in life. He has an incredibly high standard and holds people accountable while being nurturing and supportive, so those are all qualities I hope to emulate.</p><p><a href=#>MORE: Get the Details on Michelle Obama’s Fun Guest Star Role on ‘MasterChef Junior’!</a></p><h2>What’s the best advice you can give the new MasterChef contestants?</h2><p>Work hard, be curious, be disciplined, continue to practice your craft, find your passion and sources of creativity and inspiration. Don’t let one mistake trip you up, as long as you keep going and give it your all, you will feel satisfied no matter what the result is.</p><p></p><h2>You’ve been cooking since an early age — when did you know you wanted to become a chef?</h2><p>I’m a third generation cookbook author, so I grew up with a lot of talent in the kitchen at my house. I would help my abuela and other family members prepare dishes as a kid, but my mom sent me to study with Chef Paul Prudhomme when I was 16 and that really got me set on this as a career.</p><p><a href=#>MORE: Gordon Ramsay Jokes About Being Kicked Out of Parents’ Night at His Daughter’s School — “I Really Messed Up!”</a></p><h2>How much has your upbringing influenced your culinary career?</h2><p>It has influenced my entire trajectory in life, I mean one of my main goals is to carry on the traditions of my culture and pass that on to the next generations. I wouldn’t be here today if it wasn’t for my family and their support, wisdom and honoring our heritage and customs.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/masterchef-aaron-sanchez.jpg><p>Aáron with fellow MasterChef judge Gordon.</p><h2>You have a son — does he like to cook, too?</h2><p>He’s still young, but he is starting to show some interest in the kitchen. I try to get him to be as open to new things as possible, and I know he will get more curious with time. I don’t push him to follow in my footsteps, whatever makes him happy and so long as he is a good person and well rounded I feel like I’ve accomplished my job.</p><p>MasterChef airs Wednesdays at 8/7c on FOX.</p><h2>More From Closer Weekly</h2><p><a href=#>Gordon Ramsay Reveals He Doesn’t (and Won’t Ever) Share All His Fortune With His Kids</a></p><p><a href=#>Celebrity Chef Ina Garten Hasn’t Changed up Her Breakfast Diet in 10 Years!</a></p><p><a href=#>Bobby Flay’s Girlfriend Heléne Yorke Gushes About Their Romance: “He’s Such a Sweet Guy!”</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46amKunnmLAorrCoZyzZZ2WwLWx0Zyfnp5dn8Kls8RmaGxsY2qCcA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./donut-operator.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Donut Operator Biography</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./anya-taylor-joy-plastic-surgery-1256836.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Anya Taylor-Joy's Plastic Surgery: Natural Or Nip-and-Tuck?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./409878-100-summer-instagram-captions-sunny-funny-html.html>100+ summer Instagram captions that are sunny and funny</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-neck-cream.html>19 Best Neck Creams of 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./angelina-jolie-daughter-vivienne-resembles-brad-pitt-new-photo.html>Angelina Jolie's daughter Vivienne looks just like Brad Pitt in new photo from momentous outing toge</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chicagos-summer-smash-festival-signs-a-ticketing-deal-with-dice.html>Chicagos Summer Smash Festival Signs A Ticketing Deal With DICE</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./fosters-voice-reaching-his-peers-with-organization-of-school-club.html>Foster's Voice reaching his peers with organization of school club</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog.
