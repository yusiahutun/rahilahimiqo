His fashion isn’t of the edgy, hipster ilk, or wrapped under layers of conceptual fashion-speak. Instead, Saab offers sensual glamour, feminine laces and intricately embellished gowns.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The way he designs, however, “is always the same”, says Saab. “All women have strength and a certain fragility, whether they are an actress, princess or everyday woman – I want to highlight that.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I want to always respect the woman, her beauty, her femininity and her shape. My dresses are always flattering but should never outshine the person wearing it. I want the woman to wear the dress, not the dress to wear the woman.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">This formula has clearly served him well. Saab’s fashion clout is now being brought to bear on the lucrative Asian market, with his ready-to-wear and accessories lines becoming key collections.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The “Elie Saab Red Carpet” exhibition – 11 ready-to-wear gowns that were worn by celebrities such as Michelle Yeoh Choo Kheng, Li Bingbing, Zhang and Taylor Swift – is running until April 30 in Lee Gardens, Causeway Bay, near the brand’s second Hong Kong store, which opened in December.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“The recent opening of our second Hong Kong store, carrying ready-to-wear and accessories, is a direct result of a new strategy,” says Saab. “Ever since 2005, when I was invited by the Chambre Syndicale [the French haute-couture association] to present my ready-to-wear collections in Paris, I’ve wanted to reach a larger audience of women by offering pared-down daywear silhouettes that retain the elegance and refinement of the haute couture the brand’s reputation is built on.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">His ready-towear line is made for “an international woman”, he says, one who is seeking “femininity, elegance and glamour in her clothing” and who knows an exacting cut and meticulous details when she sees them.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“She might choose a pantsuit or a sober shift dress to wear to the office.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">And, for evening, if it’s a dressy occasion, a cocktail dress or gown in lace or silk chiffon with embroideries or embellishments.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Saab is also establishing an accessories signature that “is not about a single handbag, but an entire vocabulary of accessories”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">&nbsp;</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">TAKING CENTRE STAGE IN</strong> the Paris salon, with its marbled walls, soft lighting and impeccable, clean design, is a vast soft-pink couture wedding gown. Featuring a full skirt and train (the kind that Princess Diana might have favoured) and painstakingly embroidered with thousands of glistening beads and crystals, the dress is made from hand-cut Chantilly lace.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Other gowns – feather-light draped chiffon in pastel hues, flattering skintight hourglass shapes with all-over embroidery, all from the latest couture collection – are on display.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“The main inspiration behind this [latest couture] collection is the Victorian painter Sir Lawrence Alma- Tadema,” says Saab. “The first time I saw [his paintings], I felt like he designs the woman in my way. I like always drape, always chiffon, something transparent, and even in his paintings there is always this sense, as well as the flowers and petals.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/236w/public/2014/03/15/saab_22jan14_fe_elie_2617_elie_saab_rtw_aw_14-15_backstage_copy.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Alma-Tadema’s The Roses of Heliogabalus features pastel petals scattered over a fantastical scene in ancient Rome. In the same vein, hundreds of delicate floral appliques dance over Saab’s couture gowns.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I started becoming interested in fashion when I was eight or nine,” says Saab. “I would cut out dresses from newspapers and, eventually, try to dress my sisters.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Even amongst the fighting and shelling” – in 1975, Lebanon became embroiled in a civil war that would last for 15 years – “all I ever wanted to do was design when I was a child.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In 1976, his hometown, Damour, was caught in the crossfire between Christians and the Muslim Palestinians.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Their house was shelled and the family fled to Beirut and sheltered with relatives. Elie was still only 11 years old.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“When I was a teenager, I started creating dresses for women around me in the community,” says Saab. “They would talk and my name spread by word of mouth.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Although his family wanted him “to be a doctor or engineer”, Saab persevered down his chosen path, supplementing the family’s income. A following grew and, by the age of 18, Saab had officially founded his own label, with an atelier of a dozen employees.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Saab’s eponymously titled book, released this year, recounts what happened in those early years, and how a teenage designer planned an audacious couture show at Beirut’s Casino du Liban in the midst of the civil war.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">His finale dress was a Lebanese flag draped over a model’s body, a move that tugged at heartstrings and drew national press coverage, creating a brief moment of fashion poignancy in a country ravaged by conflict.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I was the first to launch as a fashion designer in all of the Middle East,” says Saab. “All these people that you know about, they are coming after me. And I am so proud to have done that.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">His main atelier, now an 80-person operation, remains in Beirut, staffed by “many of the seamstresses that have been working for me for decades”. Having paved the way for Middle Eastern designers such as Reem Acra, Rabih Kayrouz and Zuhair Murad, Saab is opening a campus in his name at the American University of Beirut, to train students in fashion design and marketing.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I am so proud of having created something which didn’t exist in my country,” he says. “I want to help and encourage talented young generations to pursue a career in fashion design.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">This is part of the reason why I created a fashion degree with the Lebanese American University and the London College of Fashion. This bachelor of arts in fashion design is the result of our joint efforts to bring world-class fashion design to Lebanon.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In 1997, Saab became the first non-Italian designer to be invited into the Camera Nazionale della Moda Italiana (the National Chamber for Italian Fashion). A few years later, he was a regular on the Paris catwalk circuit. But his real international watershed moment came when Halle Berry picked up her 2002 best actress Oscar (for Monster’s Ball) in one of his gowns (featuring a sheer top with strategically placed floral embroidery). The international press hailed him as a sensation.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Now, his company, still 100 per cent owned by Saab, has a network of stores ranging from Hong Kong to Dubai, Geneva and Mexico City, and there are plans for further expansion.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">As if to point out the direction that expansion is likely to take, incredibly well-groomed, wealthy-looking women from, seemingly, the Arab states and former Soviet bloc countries have been slipping quietly in and out of Saab’s private salon all afternoon. Couture clients, or would-be clients, presumably, eyeing creations that generally start in the several tens of thousands of euros price range.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The globetrotting designer splits his time between Lebanon, his Paris headquarters and Geneva, where his wife, Claudine, and children, Selim, Michel and Elie Jnr, live. (“Yes, it’s true,” Saab quips, “I met my wife when she visited me to be dressed for her sister’s wedding.”) “My daily routine revolves around my work,” he says. “Most of it is spent designing. When I find the time, I visit art galleries and exhibitions that might be a source of inspiration for a future collection.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">For his autumn-winter 2014/15 ready-to-wear line, which was shown at Paris Fashion Week, the work of painter Mark Rothko was a key starting point. Clean, elegant silhouettes and “a rich palette of merlot and emerald highlighted with pale rose” have been manipulated by Saab to create an “optical illusion on the female form”, on velvet, crepe, chiffon, cashmere and mink.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">His accessories came strong, contemporary and structured in “rectilinear shapes, suspended from chain and leather straps that resemble modernist jewellery”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Practicality has become increasingly important as fashion has democratised – and that has been the case even for couturiers.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I want to see women beautiful in everything, but I want my clothes to be wearable. They are not just for show.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">&nbsp;</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kuqKzwLOgp52jZL2wv9NmpJqfka%2B2r7GOmqmtoZOhsnB9k21ub25kZLqit8Stn2alkaM%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./kane-brown-family-vacation-disney-world.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>See Pics From Kane Brown's Epic Disney World Family Vacation</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./631f0eabca474178538b45b2-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Ferrari: Antes del Purosangue, Ferrari desarroll un 4 puertas que no se vendi por culpa del Fiat</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./409878-100-summer-instagram-captions-sunny-funny-html.html>100+ summer Instagram captions that are sunny and funny</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-neck-cream.html>19 Best Neck Creams of 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./angelina-jolie-daughter-vivienne-resembles-brad-pitt-new-photo.html>Angelina Jolie's daughter Vivienne looks just like Brad Pitt in new photo from momentous outing toge</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chicagos-summer-smash-festival-signs-a-ticketing-deal-with-dice.html>Chicagos Summer Smash Festival Signs A Ticketing Deal With DICE</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./fosters-voice-reaching-his-peers-with-organization-of-school-club.html>Foster's Voice reaching his peers with organization of school club</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog.
