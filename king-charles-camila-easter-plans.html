The Monarch is planning to reduce his activity for the holiday but will make an effort to celebrate with his loved ones.</p><p>Hello!’s royal correspondent Danielle Stacy reported that King Charles will still <a rel=nofollow href=# data-type=link data-id=https://www.hellomagazine.com/royalty/516111/king-charles-big-change-easter-appearance/>make an appearance</a> in his usual plans, but with some changes. “It’s understood that King Charles may attend a church service on Easter Sunday with a smaller royal turnout if his health allows it,” Stacy told the publication. “Charles has minimized his contact with larger crowds to reduce risks as he continues his cancer treatment.”&nbsp;</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/meghan-markle-king-charles.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/king-charles-cancer-update.jpg><p>Buckingham Palace confirmed on Tuesday, March 26, that Charles, Camilla, and other family members will attend the festivities at St George’s Chapel at Windsor Castle, according to multiple outlets. It’ll be Charles’ first public appearance since being diagnosed with cancer in February.</p><p>In his first official speech, Charles made <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>a thinly veiled statement about the conspiracy theories</a> that led up to Kate Middleton’s cancer announcement. The monarch didn’t appear in person at the traditional&nbsp;Royal Maundy&nbsp;Service but he did deliver a pre-recorded speech. Camilla attended the Easter service on her own.</p><p>“Ladies and gentlemen. It is for me a great sadness that I cannot be with you all today. The Maundy service has a very special place in my heart. It has its origin in the life of our Lord who knelt before his disciples and to their great surprise, washed their travel-wary feet,” he said.</p><p>“In doing so, he deliberately gave to them—and us all—an example of how we should serve and care for each other. In this country, we are blessed by all the different services that exist for our welfare but over and above these organizations and their selfless staff, we need and benefit greatly from those who extend the hand of friendship to ours, especially in a time of need.”</p><p>He continued: “The 150 men and women who’ve been chosen today to receive the Maundy money from my wife are wonderful examples of such kindness, of going way beyond the call of duty. And of giving so much of their lives to the service of others in their communities. This act of worship here, in Worcester Cathedral, reminds me of the pledge I made at the beginning of the coronation service. To follow Christ’s example, not to be served but to serve. That, I have always tried to do and continue to do with my whole heart. It is my special prayer today, but our Lord’s example of serving one another might continue to inspire and strengthen all our communities. May God bless you all this Easter.”</p><p>King Charles has reduced his Royal duties but has not stepped back from them entirely. “While we’ve seen the King conduct small audiences at Buckingham Palace, he’s not attended any large-scale gathering since his diagnosis, such as the reception for Korean War Veterans last week, the Commonwealth Day service and the memorial for the late King Constantine in Windsor last month,” Danielle adds. “Behind the scenes, the King is very much continuing with working through his daily red boxes.”&nbsp;</p><p>Meanwhile, Kate Middleton announced that she was diagnosed with cancer after abdominal surgery. According to&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>Entertainment Tonight</a>,&nbsp;<a href=#>Prince William</a>, Kate Middleton, and their three children, Prince George, 10, Princess Charlotte, 8, and Prince Louis, 5, flew in a helicopter on March 23, 2024, to Anmer Hall, located on the Sandringham Estate. The family will be spending the kids’ Easter school break at their country home where they will meet with King Charles.</p><p>In January 2024,&nbsp;<a href=#>King Charles</a>&nbsp;was admitted to a hospital for a&nbsp;<a href=#>routine procedure</a>&nbsp;to treat an enlarged prostate. But less than two weeks after the operation, Buckingham Palace announced that doctors discovered the monarch had “a&nbsp;<a href=#>form of cancer</a>” following additional tests. “His Majesty has today commenced&nbsp;a schedule of regular treatments, during which time he has been advised by doctors to postpone public-facing duties,” the palace shared in a statement on February 5, 2024. “Throughout this period, His Majesty will continue to undertake State business and official paperwork as usual.”</p><p>The statement continued: “The King is grateful to his medical team&nbsp;for their swift intervention, which was made possible thanks to his recent hospital procedure. He remains wholly positive about his treatment and looks forward to returning to full public duty as soon as possible. His Majesty has chosen to share his diagnosis to prevent speculation and in the hope it may assist public understanding for all those around the world who are affected by cancer.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2iblaGyo77IrbBmppWswHB9lm1qbW9gZLiqusZmmqGZoqGytHnCmqSipJFisqK%2F056pZqiclru0ew%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./page.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>sugar puffs</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./elaine-boeheim-married-husband-children-age-net-worth-bio-wiki.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Elaine Boeheim Married, Husband, Children, Age, Net Worth, Bio &amp;amp; Wiki</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./409878-100-summer-instagram-captions-sunny-funny-html.html>100+ summer Instagram captions that are sunny and funny</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-neck-cream.html>19 Best Neck Creams of 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./angelina-jolie-daughter-vivienne-resembles-brad-pitt-new-photo.html>Angelina Jolie's daughter Vivienne looks just like Brad Pitt in new photo from momentous outing toge</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chicagos-summer-smash-festival-signs-a-ticketing-deal-with-dice.html>Chicagos Summer Smash Festival Signs A Ticketing Deal With DICE</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./fosters-voice-reaching-his-peers-with-organization-of-school-club.html>Foster's Voice reaching his peers with organization of school club</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog.
