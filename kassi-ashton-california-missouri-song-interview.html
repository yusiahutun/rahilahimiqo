Ashton was raised in California, Mo. — yes, that is a real place, a map dot south of I-70 between Kansas City and St. Louis. The song, she says, is the antithesis of country hometown songs.</p><p class=p1>"Most of them heavily romanticize hometowns, and I think that’s really beautiful," the Belmont University grad tells media during a roundtable conversation. "But mine is a little different. It’s kind of a double-edged sword. I love it, but love to leave it."</p><p class=p1>At some point you either&nbsp;knew this girl or you were this girl. "If you&nbsp;wear cowboy boots ... I own four pair, but I’m not wearing them to school because you wear those and you’re mean to me," she says, thinking back on her high school years, which were filled with so much antagonism that counselors would she suggest her parents homeschool her.</p><p class=p1>"I would wear combat boots and a pencil skirt and a Lady Gaga T-shirt from Hot Topic just to like make people mad," she adds.</p><p class=p1>Musically Ashton is as much of an enigma as she appears to be. Classic country dominated her musical diet until she learned of <a href=#>Adele</a> and <a href=#>Amy Winehouse </a>(both of whom she's drawn comparisons to), and then <a href=#>John Mayer</a> and <a href=#>Beyonce</a>. Her parents were split up, and depending on who she was with she would lean into different extracurriculars.</p><p class=p1>At Dad's it was guns and dirt bikes. "Deer season is bigger than Christmas in my family," she deadpans.</p><p class=p1>But ...</p><p class=p1>"At moms I was in dance six days a week, beauty pageants, any stage that she could put me on," Ashton says during Country Cares weekend at <a href=#>St. Jude</a> Children's Hospital in Memphis. "So that makes me a very weird individual."</p><p class=p1>The song "California, Missouri" is an avant-garde track that tells her story. "I was born in the wrong place at the wrong time," she sings. "But sometimes the wrong way makes you the right kind." Luke Laird and Shane McAnally helped write the song, and she remembers the session as being very natural. No one worried about how to say a thing, they just said it.</p><p class=p1>The chorus goes:</p><p class=p1>"I was all in a hurry / And if I got past that one stop light I&nbsp;could get a head start on&nbsp;anything that hurt me / Anywhere I go&nbsp;don't feel like it was that good or bad /&nbsp;I don't know if I'm running away / I don't know if I'm running toward ya / i guess that's what you get when you're born and stuck in California / California, Missouri."&nbsp;</p><p class=p1>Expect more new music from Ashton in March or May and expect her sound to continue to defy genres. "I’m not trying to fit a mold," she says. "I’m trying to make a mold of myself that other people can slip into."</p><p><strong>These 12 Women Are True Country Trailblazers!</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskajBprvFnKaupqSnxm%2BvzqZmpJmjqLZurdKhq6imXZiurbXFqKmnoZFiuqq%2F0qisq6FdqLyvs4yipa2doqu2psOO</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./that-girl-lay-lay.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>That Girl Lay Lay - Bio, Age, Net Worth, Nationality, Single, Facts</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./donut-operator.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Donut Operator Biography</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./409878-100-summer-instagram-captions-sunny-funny-html.html>100+ summer Instagram captions that are sunny and funny</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-neck-cream.html>19 Best Neck Creams of 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./angelina-jolie-daughter-vivienne-resembles-brad-pitt-new-photo.html>Angelina Jolie's daughter Vivienne looks just like Brad Pitt in new photo from momentous outing toge</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chicagos-summer-smash-festival-signs-a-ticketing-deal-with-dice.html>Chicagos Summer Smash Festival Signs A Ticketing Deal With DICE</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./fosters-voice-reaching-his-peers-with-organization-of-school-club.html>Foster's Voice reaching his peers with organization of school club</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog.
