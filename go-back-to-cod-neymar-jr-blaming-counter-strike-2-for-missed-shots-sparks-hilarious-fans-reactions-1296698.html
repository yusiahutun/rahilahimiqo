He is frequently spotted playing games such as PUBG and Counter-Strike 2. He even has his own feral skin in Fortnite. He recently went off on Instagram, alleging that Counter-Strike didn't register his shot on an enemy and that he should've scored the kill. Some fans, however, believe he's not particularly good at playing the game.</p><h2 id=6620c7ad2fe55><strong>Fan asks Neymar to play “COD” as he “missed” in CS 2&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>One fan asked Neymar to go and play “COD” as CS 2 is not for him. The fan wrote, “Bro need to go back to COD”</p><p>Another fan comes in aid for Neymar saying that even the professionals sometimes “miss”. The fan wrote, “Nice try, Neymar! Even the pros miss shots sometimes. Just blame it on CS being too realistic, right? “</p><p>Another fan explained what happened to <a href=# onclick='triggerArticleInterlinkClick("article_interlink_click"," ‘Go Back To COD’: Neymar Jr Blaming Counter Strike 2 For Missed Shots Sparks Hilarious Fans Reactions","1296698","https://www.pinkvilla.com/sports/ex-barcelona-teammate-neymar-jr-helps-dani-alves-pay-off-800000-as-he-gets-sentenced-for-rape-report-1281155","articlepage","/sports/go-back-to-cod-neymar-jr-blaming-counter-strike-2-for-missed-shots-sparks-hilarious-fans-reactions-1296698","Neymar Jr.","Body_Hyperlink","sports","NA")'>Neymar Jr.</a> while playing CS 2. The fan wrote, “Shots 1-5: Clearly missed. Shots 6-9: Missed due to recoil (bad spray control). Shots 10-11: Very close, but recoil and inaccuracy make these reasonable misses. Shot 12: Likely didn't actually fire because he was already dead.” <a rel=nofollow href=# class="looms--artdiv loomsart--logodiv loomsart--logodiv-v2" onclick='trigger17LoomsEntryClick("17Looms_AP_Logo","-","-","-")'><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.pinkvilla.com/assets/images/17looms_pinkvilla_deshtop_article_entry_updated.jpg alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><span class=f14>Advertisement</span><p>Another fan asks Neymar to focus on “training” first.

However, everyone who has played Counter-Strike 2 for long enough would say they have encountered ghost bullets in the game.</p><p>What makes the video so amusing is that apart from Neymar whining over a video game is that the match score was 14-15, and Neymar was furious because the miss resulted in a tie rather than a win for his team.</p><p>Whether Neymar is correct or not, there are growing fears that Counter-Strike 2 is losing the war against cheats, with an increasing number of incidences recorded and many streams losing trust in the game. It can still not be said though whether it was a cheater who shot Neymar Jr.</p><p class=also_read_style><strong>ALSO READ:</strong>&nbsp;<a href=# onclick='triggerCommentfollowAlsoClick("article_also_read_click"," ‘Go Back To COD’: Neymar Jr Blaming Counter Strike 2 For Missed Shots Sparks Hilarious Fans Reactions",1296698,"https://www.pinkvilla.com/sports/absolutely-finished-neymar-jr-plays-poker-at-daughters-birthday-party-leaving-fans-disappointed-1294805","articlepage","/sports/go-back-to-cod-neymar-jr-blaming-counter-strike-2-for-missed-shots-sparks-hilarious-fans-reactions-1296698","Content Also read","sports","NA"),triggerArticleInterlinkClick("article_interlink_click"," ‘Go Back To COD’: Neymar Jr Blaming Counter Strike 2 For Missed Shots Sparks Hilarious Fans Reactions",1296698,"https://www.pinkvilla.com/sports/absolutely-finished-neymar-jr-plays-poker-at-daughters-birthday-party-leaving-fans-disappointed-1294805","articlepage","/sports/go-back-to-cod-neymar-jr-blaming-counter-strike-2-for-missed-shots-sparks-hilarious-fans-reactions-1296698","‘Absolutely Finished’: Neymar Jr Plays Poker at Daughter’s Birthday Party Leaving Fans Disappointed ","Also_Read","sports","NA")'><strong>‘Absolutely Finished’: Neymar Jr Plays Poker at Daughter’s Birthday Party Leaving Fans Disappointed</strong></a></p><span class=f14>Advertisement</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7sbXNpK2ipJyWe6S7zGiqqaeiqcBws85mmZqbm2LBsHnCqJtmppWuuqK%2BjKOpZpqclrqqusZmmqitnqmys3nSramio5Vif26yzqtkpqGjqLKledKhpq2rXai9or7KrGShoZyWv6q71Kxkn5meqHqzscCcq6Knnqh6cn6Yb21ycA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./balletcore-trend.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>How to Wear the Balletcore Fashion Trend for 2023</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./ernest-morgan-wallen-flower-shops-acoustic.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Ernest and Morgan Wallen Offer Acoustic Version of 'Flower Shops'</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./409878-100-summer-instagram-captions-sunny-funny-html.html>100+ summer Instagram captions that are sunny and funny</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-neck-cream.html>19 Best Neck Creams of 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./angelina-jolie-daughter-vivienne-resembles-brad-pitt-new-photo.html>Angelina Jolie's daughter Vivienne looks just like Brad Pitt in new photo from momentous outing toge</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chicagos-summer-smash-festival-signs-a-ticketing-deal-with-dice.html>Chicagos Summer Smash Festival Signs A Ticketing Deal With DICE</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./fosters-voice-reaching-his-peers-with-organization-of-school-club.html>Foster's Voice reaching his peers with organization of school club</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog.
