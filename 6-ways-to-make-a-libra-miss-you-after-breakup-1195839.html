They are also so madly in love with their lover when they do ultimately commit. Libra folks make sure they move on and into something better when they end a relationship since they have a preference for the nicest and finer things in life. Venus rules Libra, thus it may be difficult for their ex to make them miss them after a breakup because they may admire beauty and the sensation of attraction to someone new.</p><p>So, in order for you to<a href=# onclick='triggerArticleInterlinkClick("article_interlink_click","6 Ways to make a Libra miss you after breakup","1195839","https://www.pinkvilla.com/topic/libra","articlepage","/lifestyle/people/6-ways-to-make-a-libra-miss-you-after-breakup-1195839"," make your Libra ex miss you","Body_Hyperlink","lifestyle","people")'> make your Libra ex miss you</a>, check out these 6 ways in which you can make them remind of you.</p><p><img alt="Spa day" title="Spa day" width=4160 height=6240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.pinkvilla.com/images/2022-10/1666346985_pexels-anna-shvets-5069604-1.jpg></p><p><strong>1. Let them see what they are missing</strong></p><p>Indulging in your beauty and self-care is a classic way to make a Libra envious of you and make them miss you while you pamper yourself. Because Libra values beauty and fashion and is strongly influenced by Venus, you can share on social media and upload images of your indulgent self-care activities to make them miss your absence.</p><p><strong>2. Prove your commitment to them</strong></p><p>When it comes to dating, Libras are patient. Although they may not move quickly, Libras are devoted to their relationships and make significant commitments to them. Even after a breakup, if you remain faithful to them while abstaining from tomfoolery and infidelity, it will be appreciated and a Libra may even miss your dedication in a partnership.</p><span class=f14>Advertisement</span><p><img alt="Party with friends" title="Party with friends" width=4104 height=2736 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.pinkvilla.com/images/2022-10/1666347027_pexels-kampus-production-5935226-1.jpg></p><p><strong>3. Spend time with friends</strong></p><p>Considered to be the greatest social butterflies ever, Librans adore being with their pals. Showing them, you can have a good social lifestyle both with and without them and yet have as much fun will pique their attention once more and make them miss you. They'll likely start appreciating how much fun it is to be around you once they see you on the go and having a blast.</p><p><strong>4. Give them space</strong></p><p>A Libra needs room to breathe and the flexibility to be who they are at any given time. After a breakup, people want to hurt, revel, loathe, and love who they are. Because they are continuously learning new aspects of who they are, these people&nbsp;are constantly shifting and frequently contradictory. Allow them the time and space they require to miss your presence.</p><p><img alt="Don't overexpress" title="Don't overexpress" width=4607 height=3071 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.pinkvilla.com/images/2022-10/1666347076_pexels-tim-douglas-6567414-1.jpg></p><p><strong>5. Act a little mysterious</strong></p><p>Even though it can be difficult, one of the methods to make your Libra ex miss you after a breakup is to remain silent and off their sight for a while. They can become curious about you and start missing you if you don't tell them everything about yourself and leave them wondering about your next course of action in life.</p><p><strong>6. Don’t overexpress yourself</strong></p><p>Libras might sometimes come out as being cold-hearted since they are more analytical than emotive. Avoid any actions that can awaken their heartless side. Don't share too much of your personal life&nbsp;online where your Libra&nbsp;ex can see it. In fact, refrain from talking about your breakup at all online. They'll be curious and miss you because of your inaction and silence.</p><p>There is no way they will ever forget you if you follow these aforementioned ways to make them miss you.</p><span class=f14>Advertisement</span><p>Also Read:<a href=# onclick='triggerArticleInterlinkClick("article_interlink_click","6 Ways to make a Libra miss you after breakup","1195839","https://www.pinkvilla.com/lifestyle/people/4-ways-to-make-up-with-a-pisces-after-a-fight-1195749","articlepage","/lifestyle/people/6-ways-to-make-a-libra-miss-you-after-breakup-1195839","&nbsp;4 Ways to make up with a Pisces after a fight","Body_Hyperlink","lifestyle","people")'>&nbsp;4 Ways to make up with a Pisces after a fight</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7sbXNpK2ipJyWe6S7zGijop6VqMG6uMRop56noKGycIKMsJiyq12pvG65wKScZpldobajvsBmpKKro2LGsMGMmp2tnaJir7OxwKSsqWVhZoZ2hJJy</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./daniela-rajic.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Daniela Rajic - In Relation, Bio, Career , Age, Net Worth, Facts</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./turkish-airlines-doco-catering-lounge.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Turkish Airlines x Do&amp;amp;Co Catering Lounge Meet-Up</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./409878-100-summer-instagram-captions-sunny-funny-html.html>100+ summer Instagram captions that are sunny and funny</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-neck-cream.html>19 Best Neck Creams of 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./angelina-jolie-daughter-vivienne-resembles-brad-pitt-new-photo.html>Angelina Jolie's daughter Vivienne looks just like Brad Pitt in new photo from momentous outing toge</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chicagos-summer-smash-festival-signs-a-ticketing-deal-with-dice.html>Chicagos Summer Smash Festival Signs A Ticketing Deal With DICE</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./fosters-voice-reaching-his-peers-with-organization-of-school-club.html>Foster's Voice reaching his peers with organization of school club</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog.
