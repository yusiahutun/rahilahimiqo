and sent them inappropriate text messages.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Dr Brian Gilchrist resigned from Bronx-Lebanon Hospital last year after he was accused of harassing female residents, according to a lawsuit filed last week in Bronx Supreme Court.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The women behind the suit, Dr Prava Thapa and Dr Sushant Remersu, claimed that Gilchrist sent one resident a photo of himself wearing nothing but a towel and texted another about 'spanking' her.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Thapa and Remersu have now accused Bronx-Lebanon of firing them from the hospital's residency program in retaliation for complaining about Gilchrist's conduct.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The lawsuit claims that 63-year-old Gilchrist initially took an interest in Thapa, 35, but later turned his affections toward another resident in her 20s in 2017.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The surgeon allegedly emailed the unnamed woman: 'My love for you is deep ... and yes, I crave you' and would 'deliberately' make contact with her breasts during surgery.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The resident brought her complaints about Gilchrist to Thapa and Remersu, telling him that he had made her feel 'extremely uncomfortable'.&nbsp;</p><img id=i-6522b565bdb8da15
