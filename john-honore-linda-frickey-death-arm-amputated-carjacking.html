While Honore had three accomplices -- 17-year-old Briniyah Baker, 16-year-old Lenyra Theophile, and 16-year-old Mar’Qel Curtis -- they pleaded guilty to attempted manslaughter charges and were given 20-year prison sentences.</p><p>Honore's sentencing will be held on January 12, he faces a lifetime behind bars with possibility of parole in 25 years.</p><p>The carjacking was caught on video, with Honore pepper-spraying and attempting to pull Frickey from her car while punching and kicking her. She, however, was caught on her seatbelt and dragged more than 700 feet as they took off in the car, her arm severed from her body in the process.</p><p>"The defendant, after pepper spraying her, grabs her, pulls her out of her car, puts heel to her face, stomps her on the head, gets on top, punches her, gets into the driver seat and you will see decisions made that ended Frickey's life," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>prosecutors said in the courtroom</strong></a>, saying Frickey was "screaming and pleading for him to stop."</p><p>A witness, who lived nearby, said she at first thought the car was dragging a mannequin before realizing it was a neighbor.
