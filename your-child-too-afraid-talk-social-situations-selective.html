It typically affects 1 to 2 per cent of children, with a higher incidence in girls. It is not shyness.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Shy kids, once they get comfortable, can play and be themselves and be chatty and share ideas.

Maybe the parents didn’t notice because they weren’t in those environments,” says Giglio.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">How teachers can recognise signs of anxiety and depression in students</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Sixteen-year-old Arya Chawhan remembers being afraid to speak when she went to kindergarten and, as a three- and four-year-old in class, used non-verbal ways of communicating – like nodding her head.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I wanted to say things to potential friends or teachers but didn’t have the courage or bravery to do so,” says Arya.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">With the support of Giglio in her early years, she slowly grew her “brave voice” and now runs her school newspaper and a community service club, regularly speaking in front of groups.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Her advice to parents of children with SM is to understand that their child is not being difficult or obstinate, and to help make them as comfortable as possible.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“It’s great Bravery Grows is coming out.
