They were also less hyperactive and aggressive.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">The power of music therapy: from cancer patients to shy kids</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“The stress of everyday living, not knowing what would happen from one day to the next was felt in families, not only by parents, but also children who were subjected to tension at home,” she says.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">During the recent pandemic, families with special needs children, who were already dealing with stressful home lives, really suffered.

For instance, if we feel thirsty, our brains prompt us to drink.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">People with normal interoceptive awareness will be able to recognise and respond to how they feel. But children with autism often can’t do this, Wang says.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/07/05/42006aed-2382-4734-8e6e-6bcb4eb8e0ef_08331b66.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">This extends to their awareness of emotions; people with good interoceptive skills understand how to respond to their own emotions as well as those of others.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Whether by listening to it or playing an instrument, music helps to prompt a range of emotions and develop emotional awareness in those who lack good interoceptive skills, Wang says.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Once a child is able to differentiate between emotions – happiness, anger and frustration – she says, they can begin to learn how to act on those emotions, how to prevent them from escalating, which in turn helps to maintain better emotional control.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">She describes how children are encouraged to respond to the mood of a piece of music, such as by beating drums to lively music, or lying down to enjoy reflective music.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">As children get older, we introduce them to the piano, she says, “as a mode of self-expression and to build a sense of achievement and confidence”.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/07/05/c57d0520-40d9-4cbd-894f-ac329b83280f_4086c0f4.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">She describes the case of Yeung Hong Yue, who was six years old when he enrolled in the therapy centre. He had autism; he wasn’t able to speak coherently and could only repeat words spoken to him, she says. He had not coped well in mainstream school.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">After just a few sessions at Do Re Mi, “we were able to identify that he had an impeccable memory, and music had a very calming influence on him”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Honing fine motor skills is a challenge for children with autism, says Wang. Learning a musical instrument helps them to develop these, as in the case of Yeung, who developed his motor skills by learning the piano.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">He had difficulty understanding musical notation, but developed his own method of working notes out and, “using his astonishing memory”, he learned pieces quickly.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/07/05/dc05a2b5-f8c9-4d07-9888-3957665fbf15_906eff0d.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">His emotional skills improved as he learned about feelings through music. He eventually went on to do diploma-level exams with the Associated Board of the Royal Schools of Music London.</p>The most rewarding moment for Wang came in 2022 when, following 15 years of study, Yeung won first prize in his category at the 5th Hong Kong Pacific Piano Open <a rel=nofollow class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Competition</span></a> organised by East West Arts Association, the first competition to offer a section for children with special needs.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">His mother thanked Wang, saying this was her son’s first taste of success in his life.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">It wasn’t just the development of a better understanding of emotion, or even the enjoyment or success that came with music, it was the fact that the experience helped him develop a sense of self-worth.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/07/05/86a63d1a-82ea-4ee9-bf36-657404c15b6b_6083431a.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Every child deserves that, and to enjoy success and achievement,” says Wang.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Ilari agrees that music affects everyone’s mood, starting from a young age.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Parents and carers use music to help regulate mood in babies and young children,” she says. As children enter their teens, many learn to manage their moods with music.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Later in life, we often resort to the music of our youth, “as a way to feel good, to connect with memories and people”.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/07/05/f2ad1197-a9ba-4fe4-a1e0-b1200d3f4c2d_f2d37dd8.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">She refers to British sociologist Tia De Nora, who speaks about music as a technology of the self. “I really like that definition,” Ilari says.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">So when should one introduce a child to music?</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">There is a lot of discussion about the optimal age to start conventional music education, says Ilari. But the fact is, long before children take any formal music lessons, they’re already musically involved on some level – from listening to music at home or at school.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">As a result, children come to music classes with musical baggage, and it’s the teacher’s role to “unpack it” and expand it.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Children with autism can also be introduced to music from a very young age, says Wang, who describes how that might start.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“In initial consultations we would use percussion instruments where children can immediately become involved,” she says.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Early signs of autism could be picked up in child’s first month: study</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Children on the autism spectrum often fall behind in academic studies, despite many of them exhibiting incredible understanding of patterns and maths, Wang says. Music offers the chance for a real sense of achievement, whether in learning a musical piece or sitting music exams.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Listening to music or learning to play an instrument presents many opportunities for children, formal and informal. They have the chance to de-stress and to focus, to forge an identity, to collaborate with peers, to find something of themselves. All of that conspires to build confidence.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Perhaps we shouldn’t be surprised it supports healthy cognition too.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kuaqyxKyrsqSVZLWmrcutn2avlaG5r7HSrGaaqqSesK2xjmxpa25maYBwtM6wZKato56wbrTEpaesZZOdtq2w0Z6lZqSVlr%2BvecCnm2agn6x6pLTIpZurnZ5irrbAyKykZqSVlr%2Bvtc2gZKmkka56rsHSopqapF2eu7TA0a6knqakYrauvNGorZ6r</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./inside-denzel-washington-beverly-hills-mega-mansion-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Inside Denzel Washington's Beverly Hills Mega Mansion</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./11-unbelievable-facts-about-michael-schoeffling.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>11 Unbelievable Facts About Michael Schoeffling</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./409878-100-summer-instagram-captions-sunny-funny-html.html>100+ summer Instagram captions that are sunny and funny</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-neck-cream.html>19 Best Neck Creams of 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./angelina-jolie-daughter-vivienne-resembles-brad-pitt-new-photo.html>Angelina Jolie's daughter Vivienne looks just like Brad Pitt in new photo from momentous outing toge</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chicagos-summer-smash-festival-signs-a-ticketing-deal-with-dice.html>Chicagos Summer Smash Festival Signs A Ticketing Deal With DICE</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./fosters-voice-reaching-his-peers-with-organization-of-school-club.html>Foster's Voice reaching his peers with organization of school club</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog.
