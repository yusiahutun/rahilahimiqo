"[One day] I woke up and thought, 'Am I going to lose a beautiful woman who is willing to be with me to my very last breath because I am afraid to say yes to a child?' That's all it took. ...

Costner was 52 years old when Cayden was born and he admitted to PEOPLE that he had concerns about being a father over 50, adding that it also came with perks, too.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-54 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I hope I have as much energy for Cayden as I had for my first," he said. "My fundamental fear is that my new baby, someone [else] will raise him, meaning that my life will end prematurely. I won't get to coach him in what I think it is to be a man.

"He likes a good beat."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-58 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The actor also shared how he and Baumgartner were preparing Cayden to become a big brother as the couple were expecting their second child at the time.

While preparing for his action flick Criminal, Costner shared during an appearance on Today, "My children are kind of used to that — Chris has to explain, 'Daddy looks a little different sometimes at the PTA meetings.'

"</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-80 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Unlike her brothers, Grace is not into sports.
