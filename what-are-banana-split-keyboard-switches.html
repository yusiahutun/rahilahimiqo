However, for newcomers to the hobby, certain things can be confusing, specifically as mechanical switches come in dozens, if not hundreds, of different types.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Banana Split keyboard switches have been wildly popular since their late 2020 release. While they come in a rather neat housing, there's more to these switches than aesthetics that make them so popular.</p><h2 id=what-makes-banana-split-keyboard-switches-different>What Makes Banana Split Keyboard Switches Different?</h2><p>The Banana Split keyboard switches are part of the "Snack Time Switch Line" series by C³Equalz and TheKey.Company (TKC), two of the biggest names in the mechanical keyboard space. Other switches in the lineup include Tangerines, Kiwis, and Dragon Fruits.</p><p>The Banana Splits switches are a 62-gram linear switch designed by C³Equalz in collaboration with TKC and manufactured by JWK. Other vendors previously sold these switches under the working development name "Macho." However, Banana Splits aren't simply a recolor of an existing JWK switch, courtesy of a proprietary C³Equalz housing mold.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/banana-split-switches-1.jpg><p>They feature lavender and purple outer housings with a yellow stem. The housings are made from a blend of nylon and polycarbonate, with the stem made of polyoxymethylene (POM). They also come pre-lubed from the factory, although only with a light application, and you can lube them on top of that. We've already covered <a href=#>how to lube mechanical switches</a> if you're looking for reasons to lube your switches or need a quick guide to get started.</p><h2 id=how-do-banana-split-switches-sound-and-feel>How Do Banana Split Switches Sound and Feel?</h2><p>The switches themselves are constructed sturdily. While they have a little stem wobble, you likely won't notice it during day-to-day typing or gaming. Since they're linear switches, you get a smooth action all the way to the actuation point with no tactile bump. If you need a refresher on switch types, we have already <a href=#>compared linear, tactile, and clicky switches</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The 62-gram actuation force makes these switches nimble and good for both quick typists and gamers. As far as the sound is concerned, due to their construction, they have a rather high-pitch clicky sound instead of the "thock" many mechanical switches have.</p><h2 id=why-are-banana-split-switches-so-popular>Why Are Banana Split Switches So Popular?</h2><p>Since switches like this are only released in limited-time runs, they tend to be quite popular among enthusiasts wanting to get their hands on something unique.</p><p>One of the major contributing factors to the Banana Split's popularity includes the popularity of the companies that designed and manufactured the switch. JWK also manufactures other popular switches like Durocks, Everglides, and EV-Series switches. In addition, TKC has gained popularity primarily for creating keycaps and desk mats and also offers keyboard kits and keyboard switches from time to time.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Finally, reviews from popular keyboard enthusiast YouTubers like <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Filled Types</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Brandon Taylor</a>, and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Too Much Tech</a> showing off the smooth typing experience and sound profile of the switches shot them up in popularity around the time of their release.</p><h2 id=pricing-and-availability>Pricing and Availability</h2><p>For a switch that only runs from time to time, the Banana Splits are surprisingly well-priced. At the time of writing, a 10-pack of Banana Splits will cost you $7.49 on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TKC's website</a>. You can also get the switches in a 70, 90, or 110 pack for $49.99, $59.99, and $69.99, respectively.</p><p>In case the switches are out of stock when you're trying to buy them, you can find them on the aftermarket, especially with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">eBay vendors</a> or from users on the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">r/mechmarket</a> subreddit. That said, they will likely cost you much higher than TKC's retail price.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=mechanical-keyboards-can-be-fun>Mechanical Keyboards Can Be Fun</h2><p>If you're looking to spice up your keyboard, a switch is just one of the many things you can change or modify to your liking. Sure, the Banana Splits are a rather unique set of switches that'd make a great addition to your keyboard, but anything from keycaps, cables, and even entire keyboard housings can be changed to customize your keyboard to your exact preferences.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3KnqysnZ%2Bbe6S7zGiuoZmkYq6zsYybmKeZnpZ6tLzLoqtmo5Wur7Ct0Z1krK%2BZqbCpsdJo</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./who-still-together-90-day-fiance-love-in-paradise-season-4.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Who's Still Together From 90 Day Fiance Love in Paradise Season 4?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./splitsvilla-x4-list-of-21-confirmed-contestants-who-are-ready-to-fight-for-love-1197755.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Splitsvilla X4: List of 21 confirmed contestants who are ready to fight for love</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./409878-100-summer-instagram-captions-sunny-funny-html.html>100+ summer Instagram captions that are sunny and funny</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-neck-cream.html>19 Best Neck Creams of 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./angelina-jolie-daughter-vivienne-resembles-brad-pitt-new-photo.html>Angelina Jolie's daughter Vivienne looks just like Brad Pitt in new photo from momentous outing toge</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chicagos-summer-smash-festival-signs-a-ticketing-deal-with-dice.html>Chicagos Summer Smash Festival Signs A Ticketing Deal With DICE</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./fosters-voice-reaching-his-peers-with-organization-of-school-club.html>Foster's Voice reaching his peers with organization of school club</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog.
