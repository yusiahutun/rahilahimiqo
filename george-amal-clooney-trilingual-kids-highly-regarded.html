She was born to British parents and lived in Italy as a child before moving to France, where she went to an international school.</p><h2><strong>What are the benefits of being trilingual?</strong></h2><h3><strong>1. Excellent career prospects</strong></h3><p id=eDTtuQ9Pov32 data-wc=60>"In a lot of jobs, having multiple languages can be really attractive in helping you network," Kirsty says. "It gives people a heightened idea of your intelligence, even if you probably didn't work hard at learning it because you did it effortlessly as a child. It seems to be something that's highly regarded and sought after later in life professionally."</p><p id=er1larfreX7z data-wc=71>If the Clooney children are as ambitious as their lawyer mother, their multiple languages could help them out in a big way when it comes to career plans, as Kirsty explains: "In terms of usefulness, some Latin languages such as Italian or Greek are really handy for sciences and in particular for medicine. They allow you to access professional roles more easily, or at least understand the languages of those jobs."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/57f40d7fec70-amal-clooney-legs-george.jpg><h3><strong>2. It's easier to relate to others</strong></h3><p id=e_tY2d8gbRG_ data-wc=51>"Aside from the obvious being able to communicate with people in different languages, one of the key benefits of being bilingual from childhood is you get to understand the culture and the subtleties of the language which give you the ability to relate on a cultural level to people," Kirsty says.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/659e3b4f76d0-gettyimages-1848932941.jpg><p id=e9cmjyMd9VkA data-wc=57>"You know the register, you understand the sense of humour and the language so much better, which can act as a pass when you travel and meet native speakers. It allows you to access the culture a lot more easily than if you're an adult learner because you've mastered the way people think from an early age."</p><p id=e4-7X8VT-H data-wc=15><strong>DISCOVER:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Are George Clooney and Amal Clooney raising their twins in Italy?

You can express yourself freely</strong></h3><p id=epWs0YLGGyCb data-wc=77>"I find is that it can be really nice and refreshing to be multi-cultural," adds Kirsty. "You can tap into your identities depending on your mood. Some languages are really good for moaning in - for example, French - some languages are really good for expressing beauty, enjoyment of food and art - for instance, the Italian language has so many words for appreciation compared to English, there are so many ways of saying something is beautiful!"</p><p id=eT9AGkM2rxJ1 data-wc=15>We can't wait to see what Ella and Alexander Clooney do with their sought-after skill!</p><p data-wc=7 id=eax7HEifrp><a class=hm-link href=#>Visit HELLO!'s Happiness Hub for optimism-boosting content</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfnbKiuNOhmKeckpqutsDYaKSorJiav26tzZ1km5mSrnx2fJhtbm5nl5q8s7PEZpimmZxisK27zqecsmWkp7attc2grJqkXaC2pb%2BMoaCgoJyuerOxxpqpnZ2UZA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./kristin-herrera-and-daniel-novak-ii.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Kristin Herrera and Daniel Novak (II)</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./mablean-ephriam.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Mablean Ephriam dating?
