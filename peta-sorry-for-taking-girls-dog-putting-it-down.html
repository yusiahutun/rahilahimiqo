Peta was fined $500 for the violation.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>A trial had been scheduled for September, during which Zarate’s attorneys had planned to question current and former Peta employees about its euthanasia policy.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>The group later said it would pay the family $49,000 and donate $2,000 to a local branch of the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SPCA) to honour Maya. The family had sought up to $7m.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>The family’s attorney, William H Shewmake, said: “The Zarates felt that the settlement reflects the grievous loss of their beloved Maya. And it allows the Zarates to bring some closure to a very painful chapter of their lives. They’re glad the case has been settled.”</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>Both parties said in a joint statement: “Peta again apologises and expresses its regrets to the Zarate family for the loss of their dog Maya. Mr Zarate acknowledges that this was an unfortunate mistake by Peta and the individuals involved, with no ill will toward the Zarate family.”</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>Peta is mostly known for campaigns against factory farming and animal testing, often exposing unsavoury practices through undercover operations. But it also runs a shelter at its headquarters in Norfolk, Virginia.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>The shelter routinely dispatches veterinarians to care for animals but it also euthanises ones Peta deems too sick, aggressive or feral for adoption.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>Peta says the animals it puts down are often turned away by other shelters. And it said many pets are brought in by low-income owners who can’t afford to care for their elderly or sick animals.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>The organisation says it helps as many as 25,000 animals a year, spaying and neutering many free of charge. But the shelter’s euthanasia rate – it put down more than 1,400 of about 2,000 animals in 2016 – has drawn criticism from some in the so-called “no kill” shelter movement.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>The rate fuelled the family’s lawsuit, which Peta claimed was driven by “no kill” activists.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>Shelters that call themselves “no kill” typically will put down only those animals with incurable health problems or behaviours that pose a serious safety risk. But in some cases, they will place animals on waiting lists if they lack space or refer animals to other shelters.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>Peta says its euthanasia rate is partly the result of accepting animals that other shelters decline. “We’re never going to be the folks who turn animals away,” Daphna Nachminovitch, Peta’s senior vice-president for cruelty investigations, said. “If you saw those animals, there would be nothing controversial about it.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoKyaqpSerq96wqikaK2jYrumw9JoaWlpZ2SutrOOam5oqJWprm6%2FzqupsmWWpL9uwMCkoKefXZy2s7jSZpuon12lwrXAyKeeZqGkYrGww80%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./vintage-new-york.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>40 Vintage Photos of New York City</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./hong-kong-opinion.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Hong Kong Opinion | South China Morning Post</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./409878-100-summer-instagram-captions-sunny-funny-html.html>100+ summer Instagram captions that are sunny and funny</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-neck-cream.html>19 Best Neck Creams of 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./angelina-jolie-daughter-vivienne-resembles-brad-pitt-new-photo.html>Angelina Jolie's daughter Vivienne looks just like Brad Pitt in new photo from momentous outing toge</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chicagos-summer-smash-festival-signs-a-ticketing-deal-with-dice.html>Chicagos Summer Smash Festival Signs A Ticketing Deal With DICE</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./fosters-voice-reaching-his-peers-with-organization-of-school-club.html>Foster's Voice reaching his peers with organization of school club</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog.
