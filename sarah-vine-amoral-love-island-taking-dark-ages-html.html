The Teenagers, each in their unique way, are obsessed. My daughter watches it with her boyfriend; they seem to love and hate it in equal measure, taking sides furiously while at the same time disparaging the show’s obvious flaws.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Occasionally, I am drafted in to watch. On Friday night, as we observed various couples partake in a series of monosyllabic dates, culminating in Liberty (standard-issue pneumatic blonde) and Jake (equally standard-issue tattooed hunk) announcing their separation, we were transfixed by Chloe’s underboob, Liberty’s white lace trousers, and the almost comedic attempts of their co-islanders to register emotion through the multiple layers of make-up, Botox and fillers.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Afterwards, my daughter asked me if I thought she should get a boob-job.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>She is 18. I said ‘no’, obviously.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>My SON, meanwhile, takes a more straightforward, and some might say, male view. ‘I get that you hate it, Mum,’ he said, shovelling down breakfast eggs and beans yesterday morning, ‘but I don’t see what’s not to like about being sent to Majorca and being paid to have as much sex as you can with a load of fit women. Then come home to five million followers on Instagram and a bunch of brands desperate to sign you up and never having to work again.’</p><img id=i-be4241dc85f53627 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/08/21/22/46946459-0-image-m-174_1629582359444.jpg height=446 width=634 alt="Love Island contestants Kaz and Faye pictured on the show.&nbsp;There are few topics that divide opinion more keenly in my house than Love Island, writes Sarah Vine" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Love Island contestants Kaz and Faye pictured on the show.&nbsp;There are few topics that divide opinion more keenly in my house than Love Island, writes Sarah Vine</p><img id=i-8970242ceaf2fd24 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/08/21/22/46946627-9915397-image-m-176_1629582602142.jpg height=477 width=634 alt="There’s something of the Colosseum about the way these muscle-bound young people are forced to demonstrate their physical and sexual prowess for the pleasure of the spectator (file)" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>There’s something of the Colosseum about the way these muscle-bound young people are forced to demonstrate their physical and sexual prowess for the pleasure of the spectator (file)</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>He is, as you can probably tell, 16.

He is precisely the kind of market the show is aimed at – and the reason it boasts lucrative sponsorship and product-placement deals worth somewhere north of £70 million, with brands including Tinder, Just Eat, JD Sports and various other sources of youthful gratification.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>It’s also why I hate it so much. Hate it with a passion. Hate the vacuous messages it sends and the cynical way it manipulates the contestants. Hate the soapy sentiment and the overblown emotions. Hate the cookie-cutter version of physical desirability it promotes.&nbsp;</p><h2>RELATED ARTICLES</h2><ul class="rotator-pages link-xocc"><li class=rotator-prev><a href=# data-page=prev>Previous</a></li><li><a href=# data-page=1>1</a></li><li class=rotator-next><a href=# data-page=next>Next</a></li></ul><ul class="rotator-panels link-bogr1 linkro-ccox"><li><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/08/17/23/46793981-0-image-a-65_1629240333741.jpg width=62 height=60 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto> <span>SARAH VINE: If the worst that happens to my son at the...</span></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/08/14/23/46682287-0-image-m-96_1628979290458.jpg width=62 height=60 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto> <span>SARAH VINE: Joe Biden's decision to withdraw all US troops...</span></a></li></ul><h2>Share this article</h2><span class=wai>Share</span><p class=mol-para-with-font>Hate the fleshy vulgarity of it and, perhaps most of all, hate the rank hypocrisy and sheer brass neck of ITV for screening it alongside adverts for mental health charities and other empty-minded sentiment designed to gloss over the fact that four people associated with the show, including former presenter Caroline Flack, have taken their own lives. Nor am I the only one.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>This series (the seventh), has led to a record 33,540 complaints to the broadcasting watchdog Ofcom –most (24,910, to be precise) related to the episode where Faye (heavily enhanced pneumatic blonde) stomped around the villa hurling abuse at Teddy (wholly innocuous hunk) after she was shown an out-of-context clip of him saying he fancied someone else.</p><img id=i-e7a1c0ac43f43825 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/08/21/22/46946719-9915397-image-a-187_1629583067601.jpg height=446 width=306 alt="Sparking complaints: Faye and Teddy" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Sparking complaints: Faye and Teddy</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>It is, I’m afraid, just representative of everything that is depressingly soul-destroying about the modern world. The plastic surgery, the absence of morals, the something-for-nothing culture.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>But that’s not all; it also takes us back to the Dark Ages. It’s barbaric and gladiatorial in the way it presents suffering as entertainment, encouraging us to salivate and pore over glistening young bodies as we follow the fortunes – and misfortunes – of this surgically enhanced, fame-hungry group of desperados. There’s something of the Colosseum about the way these muscle-bound young people are forced to demonstrate their physical and sexual prowess for the pleasure of the spectator.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Something humiliating and dehumanising about the way they all have to sleep together in the same room, to perform their tricks beneath the constant eye of the cameras; about the way they are carted off once a week to have their nails and lash extensions topped up, their excess hair removed, their fake tans reapplied before being sent out, once again, into the arena.
