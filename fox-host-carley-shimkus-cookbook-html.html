The dishes range from&nbsp;easy-to-make appetizers, to budget-friendly mains, to indulgent desserts.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The adored host told Dailymail.com in an exclusive interview that Cooking with Friends began as a long-running segment on Fox and Friends in which anchors along with guests and reporters cook their favorite family meal - something that is 'meaningful and special' to them.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'It's just a cool way to see somebody that you usually seen in a serious role let their hair down and cook something fun that they like to make at home,' she said.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Shimkus described the moment that Fox News Books, which published the book in partnership with Harper Collins, approached her with the book idea as 'full-circle' because she was pregnant with her first child at the time, so she was cooking at home more and getting ready to prepare home-cooked meals when the baby came.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>She and her financier husband Peter Buchignani gave birth to her first child, Brock, in February and the TV star says the highlight of motherhood has been watching Brock's development as he grows up and changes.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'Even when I look back at pictures of him from four months ago - he's changed so much.

When I was in High School it was an eye-roll because you know how high schoolers are.

The base is frozen tater tots so we're not talking Michelin Stars by any means. And then it's just eggs, breakfast sausage, cheese - you pop it in the oven and put dollops of sour cream on top. It's so indulgent and so yummy,' the mom said.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Shimkus also gave a special shout-out to her barbecue devilled eggs.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>As far as her guests' contributions - the Fox news star said her fellow host Rachel Campos-Duffy provided the recipe for her lemon ricotta pancakes which they made together on Fox and Friends.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Fox's meteorologist Janice Dean also offered up one of Shimkus's favorites - a 'grilled donut'.
