She inherited biracial ethnicity from her parents, Sandra and Tony Gentry. Her father is white, and her mother is Jamaican-born and black.</p><p>Growing up, she said, her mother was someone she could confide in if she ever felt unsure about her racial identity.</p><p>In the aftermath of George Floyd’s murder, Antonia revealed how she had been subjected to racism her entire life via an Instagram confession.</p><p>“Whether it was white kids in school making jokes about my father marrying a monkey,’ being called a mixed-mongrel mutt,’ being called any colorful name under the sun, being told by white boys ‘you look better with your hair straight,’ or being told by white girls “I’d love to have a mixed baby but I don’t want to deal with all that nappy hair,”</p><p>Aside from that, the Atlanta, Georgia native appears to have had a normal upbringing. She dropped out of middle school to attend Davidson Fine Arts in Augusta, Georgia, after discovering her passion for the arts. The first play Antonia ever performed was an original work written by her mother, who also happens to have a talent for poetry and art.</p><h2><span id=Movies_TV_Shows>Movies, TV Shows</span></h2><p>Although Ginny & Georgia is Antonia’s first leading role on television, she has previously appeared in Netflix titles such as Candy Jar, a high school rom-com, and Raising Dion, a superhero series.</p><p>Being an active leader in Emory’s Rathskellar Comedy Improv troupe and performing in plays such as Romeo and Juliet and A Tempest at the Equity theater were among her proudest accomplishments.</p><h2><span id=What_is_the_Net_worth_of_Antonia_Gentry><span class="TextRun SCXW176720165 BCX8" lang=en-us xml:lang=EN-US data-contrast=none><span class="NormalTextRun SCXW176720165 BCX8">What is the Net worth of Antonia Gentry?</span></span><span class="EOP SCXW176720165 BCX8" data-ccp-props='{"201341983":0,"335559739":160,"335559740":259}'>&nbsp;</span></span></h2><p><strong>Antonia Gentry reportedly saved $300,000 for her net worth as a result of all of this.</strong></p><p><b><span data-contrast=auto>Antonia Gentry estimated Net Worth</span></b><span data-contrast=auto>, Salary, Income, Cars, Lifestyles & many more details have been updated below.

When she recorded an audition tape for Ginny & Georgia, she was stressed and working a part-time job. She was so preoccupied with finishing up a school that she almost forgot she had sent the tape. They called her for a producer session over FaceTime two weeks later, and she was already flying out to Los Angeles for the chemistry read the following week. Then there’s the blood clot issue she had while flying back and forth to audition for the role, but that’s a story for another time.</p><p>In any case, Antonia was overjoyed to play the 15-year-old mixed-race lead because she rarely saw one on-screen as a child. She told W Magazine:</p><p>“It’s rare to come across scripts [with] characters to whom you can completely relate. Ginny had finally become that to me. “Wow, this is a really great character,” I thought to myself.</p><h2><span id=Social_Media_Instagram_Facebook_and_Twitter><span class="TextRun SCXW165644025 BCX8" lang=en-us xml:lang=EN-US data-contrast=auto><span class="NormalTextRun SCXW165644025 BCX8" data-ccp-parastyle="heading 2">Social Media: Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter</span></span><span class="EOP SCXW165644025 BCX8" data-ccp-props='{"201341983":0,"335559738":40,"335559739":0,"335559740":259}'>&nbsp;</span></span></h2><p>Her Instagram followers increased to 10.8k (as of February 25, 2021) as a result of the new Netflix release.

And, of course, the living proofs of their romance have to be their social media posts, in which they appear to be very in love.</p><p>To clarify, Ezra is a composer and producer. He attended John S. Davidson Fine Arts Magnet School before attending Georgia State University to study Music Technology. He, like Antonia, called Atlanta, Georgia home.</p><p>Antonia was last seen on her boyfriend’s Instagram in late January 2021, when he asked his Insta-fam to catch Antonia on her biggest gig.
