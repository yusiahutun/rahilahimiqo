The company is transforming businesses with their comprehensive Integration Platform crafted from more than 14 years of experience. <strong>Bruce Magown</strong> is the Founder, Chairman and CEO at the InterWeave and is supported by a passionate team that is empowering businesses of all kinds with CRM integrated solutions.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Inter</strong>Weave’s<strong> Journey since the inception</strong></h2><p>Since its beginning 14 years ago, InterWeave’s focus has been to provide the best, intuitive, intelligent, configurable<strong> Smart</strong>Integration Platform for CRM for their clients, providing them leverage for comprehensive quotes, orders, payments, inventory and revenue processes within their CRM, while sourcing real-time data from Financial Applications, ACH/CC Payment Gateways, Tax Applications, eCommerce, ERP, Databases and more, all in a hub/spoke model.</p><p>True success is acknowledged when you demonstrate that you are a Practitioner in the Solutions you are integrating; Salesforce Lightening, Field Services, Accounting Transactions, Tax detail knowledge and currently over the forty-seven (47) Merchant Service Providers that we work with. This is what’s truly appreciated by the Clients who work with <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Inter</strong>Weave</a>; resources that can provide recommendations based not only on the knowledge of integrated systems process models, data architecture, data models, but the business logic of the transactions at a very detailed level.</p><p>InterWeave started life with a very large Enterprise Client. They had built the Integration Engine for that marketplace and had achieved a very prestigious first client, ACS of Dallas. They also achieved direct competition with companies like Tibco, Above All, See Beyond and others that were established, well-funded and successful. It’s when they met a company called Salesforce in 2003 and was introduced to a new technology delivery platform, SaaS. That’s when the company’s focus sharpened. <strong>Inter</strong>Weave hosted at Rackspace Managed Hosting and took three years to build the <strong>Inter</strong>Weave SaaS Edition. This, and the acceptance as an Integration Partner with Salesforce in 2006 provided the vehicle they needed.</p><p>The relaunch and rebrand of InterWeave as the <strong>Smart</strong>Integration <a href=#>Platform for CRM provides</a> intelligent Cloud Integration for SaaS Companies. The company is focused on three tenants: Financial Services Solutions, Payment Processors and Multi-Cloud integrations in a simple, configurable way. SaaS, SMB and Enterprise Clients manage their client interactions with system-specific business processes and workflow to provide an extraordinary client experience. InterWeave is fortunate that one of their first clients is with them today and the company continues to expand on the Solutions they provide to their rapidly expanding client base.</p><p>The relaunch and rebrand of InterWeave as the <strong>Smart</strong>Integration Platform for CRM provides intelligent Cloud Integration for SaaS Companies.</p><p><strong>Factors behind long-standing success of InterWeave</strong></p><p>A unique approach to a common problem has always been a backbone for the company’s success. InterWeave allows users to work within their CRM solutions in their environments and provides them with real-time information from other integrated applications. InterWeave integrates CRMs such as Salesforce, Creatio, OROCRM, Oracle Sales Cloud, SuiteCRM and others. Internally, the firm operates a Client focused approach to ensure that they are all treated to the highest possible standards of service and support. The team is required to treat clients as they would like to be treated themselves, as InterWeave understands that its clients are the driving force behind the success of the company.</p><p>The workforce is a true asset for the company. Mr. Magown says, “I am blessed that I have a great team that is centric to supporting InterWeave. It is these people, on a daily basis, that provide the support that our clients have come to expect. For me, the balance between professional and personal life is always a challenge. Family is what keeps it all together. You can go outside of yourself and focus on others.”</p><p><strong>Their offerings</strong></p><p>The company focuses on three tenants: Financial Services Solutions, Payment Processors and Multi-Cloud integrations in a simple, configurable way. SaaS, SMB and Enterprise Clients manage their client interactions with system-specific business processes and workflow to provide an extraordinary client experience. Configurable Solutions are the key here. It’s the client’s business process and workflow that is supported by the Integration; every client has a custom solution tailored to their requirements. This is quite different from other vendors Solutions, where they modify a static program with your requirements at an additional cost. With InterWeave, you may change/update your Configuration as your business processes change.</p><p><strong>Inter</strong>Weave<strong>, Taking a step further with</strong></p><p>Be focused on your client’s needs. When you work with these great clients, day in and day out, you establish a relationship that far exceeds the standard vendor/client norm. You are deep into the client’s needs; your challenge is given the architecture of the systems you are integrating, how you will configure their Solutions to support their business process and workflow. The clarity of the company’s three tenants is now being brought across multiple CRMs.</p><p>InterWeave is currently establishing a Canadian Corporation, to better serve their Canadian Clients and is looking to do the same in the UK. InterWeave is pushing forward with new CRM partners to extend our presence in the global marketplace. It is a well-established company today with a rock-solid foundation. With their re-branding and re-launching completed, expanding the business supports their key focus; client acquisition and client support.</p><p><strong>Looking Ahead</strong></p><p><strong>Inter</strong>Weave is looking forward to the future with renewed vigour and plans to further expand its service offerings. The <strong>Inter</strong>WeaveTax Solution for Salesforce and the <strong>Inter</strong>Weave Client Portal supporting Order Management, Payments and Billing is available and being extended with Renewals, Collections, Revenue Recognitions and more. Its these developments that will allow the firm even greater opportunities to grow and build upon its current success. Additionally, they are working with their new partners; Creatio and OROCRM, to bring the inventory of Solutions they have developed to their environment. The Company looks forward to working with these new Partners and Clients.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Mr. Bruce Magown – A leader with the holistic approach of growing together</strong>.</h2><p>Mr. Bruce Magown is the Chief Executive Officer, President, Board Member, and Investor in Integration Technologies, Inc., (dba) <strong>Inter</strong>Weave <strong>Smart</strong> Solutions, which provides a SaaS, IaaS Integration Services.
