Cameron continues to dominate the competition, as we’ve seen him <a href=#>become the Head of Household multiple times</a>. In week 9, he has even more power as the HOH and the Power of Veto holder. But his home life remains somewhere of a mystery.</p><p id=par-2_24>Several houseguests have talked about Cameron’s alleged flirtation. So, does he have a relationship back home? Here’s what we know about Cameron Hardin’s wife.</p><h2 id=h-who-is-big-brother-25-houseguest-cameron-hardin-s-wife-here-s-what-we-know>Who is ‘Big Brother’ 25 houseguest Cameron Hardin’s wife? Here’s what we know</h2><p id=par-3_35>Big Brother 25 houseguest Cameron Hardin received much attention for how he behaved around America Lopez <a href=#>and Blue Kim</a>. And some fans wondered about his personal life at home. So, does Cameron have a wife?</p><p id=par-4_72>Technically, Cameron’s still married to Skylar Hardin. The two had their wedding in July 2016 and were initially spotted together in July 2014. Together, they have a daughter — Stevi Rae Hardin — who was born before their wedding day. Stevi turned 8 years old in August 2023, and he posted about it on Instagram. Cameron posted three photos to commemorate his daughter’s birthday, and not a single one contained his wife.</p><p id=par-5_49>“Hootin’ and hollerin’ because today is Stevi’s birthday!” he captioned the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">post</a> on Aug. 22. “Happy birthday to the sweetest, animal-loving, sassy, caring, smart, and fun little girl! Here is to another year of loving her sweet soul. Share the love for her today and tell her HAPPY BIRTHDAY!”</p><p id=par-6_98>At the beginning of the season, fans may recall that Cameron stated he’s currently separated from his wife, Skylar. It’s unclear where their relationship will stand after the season ends, especially with Cameron still in the house. There isn’t much information about Skylar, but she reportedly went to the same high school as him. She also served in the United States Air Force and now works at a credit union. In the past, Cameron mentioned that he was a stay-at-home dad, so it seemed like he stayed home with their daughter while Skylar tended to her day job.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Cameron-Hardin-Big-Brother-25-1.jpg><h2>Blue Kim and America Lopez accused him of creepy behavior in the house</h2><p id=par-7_43>Cameron Hardin’s relationship with his wife remains mysterious as Big Brother 25 continues. But some fans may recall Blue Kim and America Lopez <a href=#>discussing Cameron’s unsavory behavior</a> in the house. During the live feeds, the women talked about feeling uncomfortable around Cameron.</p><p id=par-8_52>“Cameron has been over-flirting quite a bit earlier in the week,” America said. ” … Cameron said something … I don’t know. Maybe I misunderstood. He was saying there are no cameras or microphones in the jury house, right? He was insinuating. Like, if we were in the jury house together ….”</p><p id=par-9_66>“He was talking to Cory yesterday, and he told him …, ‘Well, you know, if you and America are in the jury house together, there are no cameras or microphones.’ Cory was like, ‘What’s his game? What is he getting at? Is he talking about me and you or you and him?’” America continued. “I told him I think he was talking about BOTH of you.”</p><p id=par-10_8>“He is such a creep, dude,” Blue concluded.</p><p id=par-11_36>However, later on, America admitted that she flirts with Cameron, too. Either way, America might think it’s better for her game to flirt with Cameron, as this could prevent him from nominating her in the future.</p><p id=par-12_9>This story was originally reported by <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Gossip Next Door</a>.</p><p id=par-13_11>Big Brother&nbsp;Season 25 airs on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Sundays on CBS.</p><p id=par-14_15>For more on the entertainment world and exclusive interviews, subscribe to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Showbiz Cheat Sheet’s YouTube channel</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGSvqrOMm6morJiav25%2BlGaamqWVp7yveceaqZ2hnqh6uLXFnmWhrJ2hfA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./artists-that-disappeared.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>'What Ever Happened to ... ?' 18 Country Artists That Disappeared</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./shonda-rhimes-net-worth-weight-loss-journey-husband-or-partner-children.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Shonda Rhimes Net Worth, Weight Loss Journey, Husband or Partner, Children</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./409878-100-summer-instagram-captions-sunny-funny-html.html>100+ summer Instagram captions that are sunny and funny</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-neck-cream.html>19 Best Neck Creams of 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./angelina-jolie-daughter-vivienne-resembles-brad-pitt-new-photo.html>Angelina Jolie's daughter Vivienne looks just like Brad Pitt in new photo from momentous outing toge</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chicagos-summer-smash-festival-signs-a-ticketing-deal-with-dice.html>Chicagos Summer Smash Festival Signs A Ticketing Deal With DICE</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./fosters-voice-reaching-his-peers-with-organization-of-school-club.html>Foster's Voice reaching his peers with organization of school club</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog.
