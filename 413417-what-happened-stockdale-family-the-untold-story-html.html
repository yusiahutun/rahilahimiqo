The best shows about families are sitcoms and family shows that give viewers a break from their own families and give us a peek into the best fictional family lives. The Stockdale family is a perfect illustration of families gracing the television screens with their acting prowess.</p><h2>About the Stockdale family</h2><p class=align-left>The Stockdale family includes Jacob Stockdale and the late Kathryn Barbara Stockdale, the parents of Calvin Stockdale, Charles Stockdale, and the late James William Stockdale. Jacob is the family’s fiddler, known for winning the Ohio States Grand Fiddle Championship. The family lived on their family farm in Ohio.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/2453fb01f94bdc72.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>The Whittaker inbred family story: Everything you should know</span></p></a><h3>Who was Kathryn Stockdale?</h3><p class=align-left>Kathy Stockdale was described as a loving mother, grandmother, daughter, sister, aunt, friend, and mentor. She was a staunch Christian known for disciplining and instilling the best values in her sons. Kathryn had done everything right while raising her sons, including limiting their access to obvious pleasures such as video games, dating, and TV.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/2453fb01f94bdc72.jpeg><p class=align-left>Kathryn had also trained her children on house chores as she had an elaborate system that saw the boys get rewarded by tokens, and once one had earned enough tokens, one would turn that in for recreational privileges. For instance, twenty tokens would win one a ticket to listen to a family-friendly approved show.</p><h3>The Stockdale family band</h3><p class=align-left>The Stockdale family band was no ordinary band as they competed and won in several regional competitions. The band often performed at bluegrass gatherings, inspiring people around them. It did not only perform in Ohio as they travelled around performing in different states around the United States.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/c09299b647a70424.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Meet the real-life partners of the cast of The Walking Dead</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The family was successful in creating three albums.
