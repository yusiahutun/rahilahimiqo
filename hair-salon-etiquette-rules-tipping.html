With COVID hitting salon businesses hard with closures and limiting clientele, hairdressers today are still reeling from the economic free fall of 2020. Tipping has never been more vital to recouping those losses.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"For&nbsp;service&nbsp;providers, the shutdowns were some of the worst," says <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Dell Miller</a>, master colorist and extensions specialist at <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>Spoke & Weal</a>. "Like everyone else we speak to, it's been&nbsp;incredibly draining and we are&nbsp;relieved to have it somewhat in the rearview&nbsp;mirror. But now prices are up. Supplies are up. Cost of living is up. There is financial turbulence everywhere. Big business boomed&nbsp;through 2022&nbsp;and now layoffs are reeling."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Tipping&nbsp;is important because as a commission-based worker, 20 percent of your income can be tips," adds Taylor Carter, co-founder of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>East-West&nbsp;Salon&nbsp;Co</a> in Boston. "So when someone isn’t properly&nbsp;tipping&nbsp;over time, it can really decrease your annual earnings."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">So if you're wondering how much you should be tipping and whether you should be tipping the entire team, you've come to the right place. We asked Miller, Carter, and other <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>hairstylists</a> to break down the intricacies of tipping at the salon, and exactly who should get what.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Getty Images</span></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-for-your-stylist></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>For Your Stylist</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">For starters, 20 percent of the price of any service is considered the standard as far as how much to tip your stylist, but you should also remember to include all of the people involved in the process. "In the salon, you should tip your hairstylist, but also the people who come with your stylist — their assistant, the person shampooing your hair, and maybe the coat check if you leave anything there," says Francois Fortin, senior stylist at New York City's <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Salon Ziba</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Many salons have the option for you to leave the tip at the front desk when you pay, and that typically gets split up among each party. But if you prefer to divvy it up yourself and hand it to each person directly, you can do so. Colorist Beth Minardi suggests tipping the person who shampoos your hair anywhere from $3 to $5. Since many salons are unable to add the tip onto the final amount should you choose to pay with a card, she recommends using cash to ease the process.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-for-your-colorist></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>For Your Colorist</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Just as you would tip your stylist who cuts and styles your hair, Miller says a 20 percent tip is the standard here, too, and many hairdressers may expect this. There is a lot to consider when you do tip, though, and if 20 percent doesn't feel right to you, you can try figuring out what is appropriate in different ways that feel right.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"If you are going to a premium&nbsp;salon&nbsp;with&nbsp;hairdressers&nbsp;who have invested in&nbsp;their profession over time and whose prices&nbsp;reflect this&nbsp;experience and&nbsp;expertise, choose a dollar&nbsp;amount that works for you," he says. "I have hair-extension guests who pay thousands of dollars for the service [and] I do not&nbsp;expect a 20 percent&nbsp;tip. Some guests love to&nbsp;tip&nbsp;and have the resources to do this — great.&nbsp;Some guests may have the resources but may feel more&nbsp;comfortable leaving a dollar amount that would be much lower than 20 percent of the&nbsp;service price."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_22-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">On the other hand, if you're seeing a hairstylist you love who charges much less, "you may&nbsp;feel good leaving a&nbsp;higher dollar&nbsp;amount and&nbsp;disconnecting to the 20-percent standard," Miller says. "They may also be set up to rely more on&nbsp;tips."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_24-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Not sure where your colorist might fall? "When seeing any type of service provider, typical industry standard is your best bet," adds Carter. "If you are particularly close with your&nbsp;stylist,&nbsp;tipping&nbsp;on the generous side is always appreciated."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-for-your-stylists-assistant></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_26-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>For Your Stylist's Assistant</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_27-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">When it comes to tipping your stylist's assistant, Michelle Lee, master designer and manager at Boston's <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Salon Eva Michelle</a>, suggests between $5 to $20 depending on how much interaction you have with them. "All the assistants are in-training to be stylists, and at many places, a lot are working at minimum wage, so anywhere from $5 to $20 is fine depending on how much they end up doing for the client, or if they have been especially gracious to you," she says.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_29-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">That means if an assistant ends up, for instance, providing a complimentary blowout with a color service, then you’ll want to consider a heftier tip, says Paul Labrecque, celebrity stylist and founder of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Paul Labrecque Salon and Spa</a>. He says that about $20 to $30 would be pretty standard, depending on where you live.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-for-your-shampoo--conditioner-person></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_31-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>For Your Shampoo / Conditioner Person</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_32-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Miller says that while any dollar amount is good, you can even go upwards to $5 to $10 if you can afford to. He would also ask how your salon handles gratuity, as some places might pool their tips. "At Spoke & Weal, our master stylists pool a percentage of tips for the support team — as we do not want a shampoo to be incentivized by a guest&nbsp;tip&nbsp;opportunity," he says. "That doesn’t prevent guests from&nbsp;tipping&nbsp;our support individually if they prefer. We just also want to make things easy and fluid for all so the support has a dedicated pool&nbsp;distributed based on the percentage of hours worked."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-for-the-salon-owner></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_34-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>For The Salon Owner</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_35-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As for the myth that you aren't supposed to tip the salon owner when they're the ones giving you a cut or color treatment? Minardi, Lee, Labrecque and Fortin all agree it's exactly that — a myth. "I think that's an old-school thing, and I don't really know where that came from. It's definitely not expected, but it's appreciated, and we're always grateful," Lee says. "Taking myself as a salon owner out of this, if I go somewhere and I have a really good service I'm satisfied with, I want to tip the person and let them know they're appreciated." Of course, not every salon owner is the same, so if in doubt, make sure to ask the receptionist when you're making the appointment or are paying post-service if the owner accepts tips.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_39-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">If you scored a discount on your service, then figuring out how much to tip can be a challenge, especially since many deal sites won't list the price of the original treatment. The stylists were somewhat divided on this topic. While Lee thinks tipping 20 percent of the original price would be fine, Minardi and Fortin agree that tipping 20 percent of the discounted price is also acceptable. "That's another tricky one, but with promotions and discounts, the goal is to get them to come back for other services, so it's okay if you don't get the full tip," Fortin says. "That's part of the deal."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_41-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As for holiday tips, Labrecque says they are neither mandatory, nor expected: “People show their kindness and gratitude in many ways throughout the year.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_43-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Bottom line? Just like a stellar piano solo onstage garners a standing ovation from the audience, talented hairstylists should also be awarded, with 20 percent considered the industry standard. Though if your stylist goes above and beyond the call of duty, you can always feel free to do the same with your gratuity.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_45-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Updated by <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Audrey Noble</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57zZ6urGeYlrazedKao6imXZrBqr3UnqutnV2nwq2x0maroqignruo</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./loretta-lynn-ernest-surgery-update.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Loretta Lynn's Family Shares a Tough Update on Her Son's Health</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./hk-post-adds-trustsign.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>HK Post adds TrustSign | South China Morning Post</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./409878-100-summer-instagram-captions-sunny-funny-html.html>100+ summer Instagram captions that are sunny and funny</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-neck-cream.html>19 Best Neck Creams of 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./angelina-jolie-daughter-vivienne-resembles-brad-pitt-new-photo.html>Angelina Jolie's daughter Vivienne looks just like Brad Pitt in new photo from momentous outing toge</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chicagos-summer-smash-festival-signs-a-ticketing-deal-with-dice.html>Chicagos Summer Smash Festival Signs A Ticketing Deal With DICE</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./fosters-voice-reaching-his-peers-with-organization-of-school-club.html>Foster's Voice reaching his peers with organization of school club</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog.
