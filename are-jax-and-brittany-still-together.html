Of course, folks think that a lack of presence on your partner's social media can be a sign of trouble in paradise.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>However, Jax instantly put the rumors to rest by posting himself and Brittany attending the 2022 People's Choice Awards and interacting with fans in the comments sections.</p><p>"You two look incredible together!

My focus is on that," he said at the time. "It's just not fair to the show either to be like, 'OK, I'm going to sign up for this but I’m only going to be able to do these, this, and this.'

He's among other notable reality TV characters from various shows, but his drive to compete on the show comes from the possibility of winning prize money for his and Brittany's family.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Jax and Brittany may be back for a 'Vanderpump Rules' spinoff.</h2><p>In June 2023, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Variety</a> reported that Brittany and Jax, along with another former Vanderpump Rules star Kristen Doute, are in talks to get their own Bravo series. The show would follow the three of them and their own circle of friends outside of the SUR family. If this does come to fruition, then chances are, Jax is nowhere near as finished as reality TV as we once thought.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhflr%2Bmecmar2aZnpl6o77IrauapqliwLW1y6VkraeXmsGpsdE%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./kyle-richards-interview-rhobh-drama-style-tips.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Exclusive: Kyle Richards on RHOBH controversy, her style secrets and her royal style icon</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./pelo-encrespado-humedad-como-evitarlo-consejos.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>14 consejos para combatir el pelo encrespado cuando llueve</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./409878-100-summer-instagram-captions-sunny-funny-html.html>100+ summer Instagram captions that are sunny and funny</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-neck-cream.html>19 Best Neck Creams of 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./angelina-jolie-daughter-vivienne-resembles-brad-pitt-new-photo.html>Angelina Jolie's daughter Vivienne looks just like Brad Pitt in new photo from momentous outing toge</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chicagos-summer-smash-festival-signs-a-ticketing-deal-with-dice.html>Chicagos Summer Smash Festival Signs A Ticketing Deal With DICE</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./fosters-voice-reaching-his-peers-with-organization-of-school-club.html>Foster's Voice reaching his peers with organization of school club</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog.
