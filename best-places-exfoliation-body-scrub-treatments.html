As a time-poor mum to a young toddler, I was thrilled to be invited to try the HydraFacial at <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>London Premier Laser & Skin</a>'s Clapham clinic, close to Clapham Common tube station.&nbsp;</p><p id=ekBrVc0rOs4 data-wc=63>It's a 60-minute, six-step machine-based treatment which uses advanced, patented vortex technology to deeply cleanse the skin and by the end, giving you that instant gorgeous glow. It begins with lymphatic drainage to improve circulation and help to eliminate detox, followed by a gentle exfoliation and peel, which uses a combination of salicylic and glycolic acid to help loosen impurities from your skin.&nbsp;</p><p id=e4ZxXadQiia data-wc=53>The fourth step is extraction and hydration, where debris is removed from your pores using the machine's pore vacuum. Your skin is then prepped with antioxidants and peptides for maximum glow, before the sixth and final step using LED light therapy. The red and infrared light helps to reduce redness and stimulates collagen.&nbsp;</p><p id=ek8uEy9jqFB data-wc=43>The treatment is non-invasive and there's no downtime required so it's something you can fit into your lunch break or after a busy day at work.

After a long day, this relaxing facial was the perfect tonic to round off my day - 45 minutes of pure bliss! What I found fascinating was that this new facial combines anti-bacterial and anti-inflammatory red and blue LED light therapy to help heal the skin and trigger tissue repair by using a gently resurfacing Orbital Microdermabrasion to deep clean the skin on areas of concern. This also aided with a skin-repairing wrinkle comb before finishing with the new purifying silvemask for calm, collected and glowing skin.</p><p id=ea95z8CkoH data-wc=7><strong>Reviewed by Sharnaz Shahid,&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Deputy Online Editor</a></p><p id=eLrNcOXAhc data-wc=14><strong>MORE:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=# rel=noopener>23 best firming body lotions that are like a bootcamp for your bod</a></p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
