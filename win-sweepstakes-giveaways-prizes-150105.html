But sometimes, it is everything — especially when you have the chance to <a href=#>win cash sweepstakes</a>, fabulous <a href=#>household</a>, <a href=#>travel</a>, and <a href=#>tech</a> giveaways, and more fun prizes that will make your life easier and better than it was yesterday.

So, what makes us different from all those other online sweepstakes sites? Well, entering to win any prize on a Bauer Media Group’s Win It site is safe, fun, and easy! So easy, here are all the steps (five to be exact!):&nbsp;</p><li>Simply choose a giveaway/sweepstakes you wish to enter.&nbsp;</li><li>Enter your email address.&nbsp;</li><li>Click on the “Enter This Drawing” button to be taken to a page where you must take an action of your choosing in order to process your entry. It could be anything from watching an ad/video or taking a survey from one of our advertising sponsors.&nbsp;</li><li>Once the action is complete and you click “Finish,” you’ll see a confirmation page that assures that your prize entry has been received.&nbsp;</li><li>Do it all over again!&nbsp;</li><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2017/12/sweepstakes-giveaways-prizes-win-it-travel.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What are the rules for entering First for Women sweepstakes and giveaways?</h2><p>Rules are rules! But our rules aren’t hard and don’t contain hidden messages that try to pull one over you. The rules are basically there to let you know how often you can enter a giveaway or sweepstakes. All that we ask from you is an email address. We promise that it will never be given to a third party. We wouldn’t want it to happen to us, and we certainly wouldn’t want it to happen to you. If you’re already reading this and have tons of more questions, <a href=#>read our FAQ page</a> so you can rest easy and start entering already.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What types of prizes can you win through our giveaways and sweepstakes?</h2><p>You mean, what type of prizes can’t you win! We work hard to find the latest and greatest products and services in the categories of <a href=#>Events</a> (gift bags from Hollywood parties), <a href=#>Travel</a> (all-inclusive trips across the country and overseas), <a href=#>Beauty & Fashion</a> (high-end skin care lines and new clothes and accessories), <a href=#>Cash</a> (put some money in the bank), <a href=#>Household</a> (kitchen appliances, mattresses, and more), <a href=#>Tech</a> (name-brand devices, TVs, and other electronics), and giveaways that are <a href=#>Ending Soon</a> (we wouldn’t want you to miss out on anything!) for you to win. Not to mention that new <a href=#>cash sweepstakes</a> in varying amounts are always popping up each and every month. That’s why you have to keep on coming back to see what’s new.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><h2 class=wp-block-heading>How do I know if these sweepstakes and giveaways are legit?</h2><p>Have you seen our winners? No? Well, sometimes smiles speak louder than words! We love showcasing our happy winners by adding them to the <a href=#>Winner’s Circle page</a>, where you’ll see where they’re from and what they’ve won, and on our <a href=#>Facebook page</a>, where we share winner photos, exciting new prize alerts, and special limited-time flash prizes.&nbsp;</p><p>Start entering to start winning today!
