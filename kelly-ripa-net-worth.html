It is what I like to do the most. I like creating spaces for other people to be on camera,” she said. “I’ve written a couple of scripts. I’m hoping that maybe as time goes on, I’ll be able to pull away from being on camera and get behind the camera, because I really do like the creative process. But I don’t love being in front of the camera. It’s never something I’ve loved, but it’s the only way I’ve found that I’ve been able to make a living. But I really do prefer being off camera more than on camera. So, that’s where I would see myself heading.”</p><p>So what is <a href=# rel=noopener>Kelly Ripa’s net worth</a> and how much does she make for Live With Kelly?

Kelly Ripa’s net worth is <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">$120 million</a>, according to Celebrity Net Worth. In comparison, her former Live co-host Ryan Seacrest’s net worth is <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">$450 million</a>; Michael Strahan’s net worth is <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">$65 million</a>; and Regis Philbin’s net worth was <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">$150 million</a>. Ripa’s husband Mark Consuelos’ net worth is $<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">40 million</a>.</p><p>Along with Live With Kelly, Kelly Ripa’s net worth also includes what she made from her acting career on shows like All My Children, which she starred on as Hayley Vaughan from 1990 to 2002; and Hope & Faith, which she starred on as Faith Fairfield from 2003 to 2006. Kelly Ripa’s net worth also includes what she earns from from her production company, Milojo, which she founded with her husband, Mark Consuelos, in 2007.</p><p>In her 2022 book, <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Live Wire: Long-Winded Short Stories</a>, Ripa revealed that sought therapy after becoming unhappy at work. In the book, Ripa wrote that she sought therapy after she believed she was suffering from depression until her therapist told her that she thought her job was making he “miserable.” “At that time, a different time, a pre-#metoo #timesup time, a pre-women belong in the room where decisions are being made, I. Was. Miserable,” she wrote. She adds that she left her therapist’s office “without a prescription but with some breathing techniques for when shit really hit the fan.”</p><p>In Live Wire, Ripa also wrote about her struggle with balancing work and family. “Twenty-plus years ago, when my children were small, women really didn’t mention their needs as working mothers,” she wrote. “Probably because that would have been met with scorn and a possible demotion or pay decrease.” Ripa added that she was left to “push down the guilt” of missing school events and act like she was “managing it all.”</p><p>Ripa also told <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Shondaland</a> in 2022 about why she wanted to include stories about her struggle with work-life balance in her book. “They popped up when I reviewed things I had written down at night, when I was going through certain things at work,” she said. “Twenty years ago, there was no conversation over power dynamics, workplace ethics, or workplace equality. That was not a discussion. If you were a working mother, you certainly didn’t complain about anything because you were so fearful that it might somehow impact your ability to further your career or earn a living. I didn’t want that. I felt like I was doing more good [by] working and raising a family. I felt like it was a benchmark I hadn’t seen very much of and that it was important to be seen.”</p><p>She also confirmed to Shondaland that she was in a better place with her relationship with work. “Absolutely, but it took me decades to get there. I don’t want any other woman that one day inherits my job or any other job to have to get to the decades part. It shouldn’t take decades,” she said. “I think that women in general—I’m going to gender stereotype, which I don’t like doing, but I’m going to—have a hard time advocating for ourselves because we are used to being the advocates for everyone else, to make sure everyone else is okay, and putting ourselves last. In the entertainment industry, it has been counted on for women not to make noise or be disagreeable. It took me decades to learn that that was not okay and that the way I advocate for everyone else, I must apply to myself.”</p><p>She also told the site what she learned about work and her job as a hostfrom her former Live co-host Regis Philbin. “I learned how to treat the job as a job, which I think is the most important thing. He taught me to be a really good storyteller,” she said. “He was the best storyteller I’d ever met. When he took you on a journey, he took you there — you were there in the room; you got the picture. The most important thing, and I think I adapted this into my own writing, is that you have to be the fool in your own story. You can’t tell a story at somebody else’s expense. It’s not cool, it’s not chic, it’s not funny. It’s not cool to punch down. I try to make myself the idiot of every story. And quite frankly, I had limitless supply because I’ve been in this business for 33 years, so I have nothing but material.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Live-Wire-Kelly-Ripa.jpeg><p><span class="_text_y7yck_1 _text_153t8_1" data-component=text data-alias data-alignment data-theme=product-price data-transform data-truncate>$16</span><span class="_text_y7yck_1 _text_153t8_1" data-component=text data-alias=buy-now__original-price data-alignment data-theme=product-price-strikethrough data-transform data-truncate>$28.99</span><span class="_text_y7yck_1 _text_153t8_1" data-component=text data-alias data-alignment data-theme=product-percentage-off data-transform data-truncate>45% Off</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>For more about Kelly Ripa, read her 2022 memoir, <a href=# rel=nofollow><span class=s2><i>Live Wire: Long Winded Short Stories</i></span></a>.
