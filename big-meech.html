Along with his brother Southwest T., the siblings started selling $50 bags of cocaine on the streets of Detroit. It was when the duo was still in their high school years back in the late 1980s.</p><p>By 2000, the sibling duo already established a large organization. This organization had multi-kilogram cocaine distribution sales in a number of states in the USA. Some of these states include Alabama, California, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Michigan, North Carolina, and Tennessee among many others. An investigation of 2 years by the Flenory organization estimates that this said organization had a nationwide membership of over 500 individuals.</p><p>In November of 2007, the siblings admitted to running a continuing criminal enterprise. Then in September 2008, the siblings were both sentenced to 30 years in prison. The reason was that the duo ran a nationwide cocaine trafficking ring that lasted from 2000 to 2005.</p><h4>More details</h4><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-178072 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/fresherpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Big-Meech-on-the-cover-of-a-magazine.jpg alt="Big Meech" width=650 height=867 data-sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-178072 class=wp-caption-text>Caption: Big Meech on the cover of a magazine.
