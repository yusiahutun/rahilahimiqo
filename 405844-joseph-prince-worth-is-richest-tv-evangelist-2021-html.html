His father was an Indian Sikh priest. He studied in Perak Malaysia for his primary school, then proceeded to Commonwealth Secondary. He completed his A levels at Our Lady of Lourdes.</p><p class=align-left>Before founding his church, he worked as an IT consultant. He changed his name when he became a professional, saying that it was easier for people to understand. This proved to be true as his church grew, and he became a household name.</p><p class=align-left>Joseph Prince married Wendy Prince, the love of his life in 1994. She was a member of his congregation. Their relationship has been described as loving, with Wendy being seen as a warm, kind and supportive wife.

It is a non-denominational Christian church and a member of the National Council of Churches of Singapore. In 1990, they appointed Joseph as Senior Pastor. Under his leadership, the church moved from 2000 followers to 34,000 attendees in 2020.</p><p class=align-left>The growth of the church was evidenced by their ability to purchase large parcels of real estate. This includes a 5000-seater performing theatre for $366 million in 2016. They then <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">purchased the mall</a> where the church sits, which is worth $296 million, from Asia's largest real estate group.</p><p class=align-left>Pastor Joseph has a signature animated and often dramatic style of preaching. This seems to have pulled in legions of followers. He also has a large online following stemming from his telecast, ''Destined to Reign'', broadcast in over 150 countries. He also has a personal <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">website</a> where partners donate to support his ministry.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/c5dbb48e101cd300.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=30><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Jace Norman bio: Net worth, wife, height, movies and TV shows</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Prince has also spoken at many conferences and churches worldwide. These include the Hillsong church in Australia, Canada, Norway, <a href=#>South Africa</a> and the United States. He is highly sought after, and the numbers he rakes in with his messages of grace are definitely popular with his followers.</p><p class=align-left>New Creation Church is also involved in several charitable activities throughout Asia. These include an orphanage in Thailand.</p><p class=align-left>Joseph has authored 16 <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">books</a>. His first book, published in 2007, is titled ''Destined to Reign: The Secret to Effortless Success, Wholeness, and Victorious Living.'' One of the more recent ones is ''Anchored: Finding Peace in the Storms of Life'', which was authored in 2018.</p><h3>Joseph Prince salary</h3><p class=align-left>In 2008, Pastor Prince <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">stated</a> that he earned upward of $50,000 a month but with multiple pay cuts. In March of the following year, reports arose that the church paid one of its employees between $500,000 and $ 550,000 in the last financial year.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/c048078f820f740f.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=30><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>RegÃ©-Jean Page: ethnicity, wife, net worth, movies and TV shows</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Without disclosing his identity, the church cited that it was their policy to reward key church contributors. They further added that Pastor Joseph was a big pillar of the church.</p><p class=align-left>This sparked many conversations about the finances of religious organizations. However, in April of the same year, Deacon Matthew Kang of Prince's church responded to this debate by saying that the church was not a public charity, neither did it solicit donations.</p><p class=align-left>In 2014, an entertainment website published an article that ranked Pastor Prince as the 10th richest pastor in the world, with a net worth of $6.4 million. His church, however, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">denied the report</a> claiming he had a much lower net worth and that the information was personal. They added that he had not received a salary since 2009.</p><h3>Pastor Joseph Prince worth</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/9c05f56eebfa9ec5.jpg><p class=align-left>According to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Celebrity Net Worth</a>, Pastor Prince net worth is $5 million.
