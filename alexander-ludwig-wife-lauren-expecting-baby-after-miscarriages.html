"We suffered 3 losses before this one but each one of those losses taught us about ourselves and each other."</p><p>Lauren then concluded her post by sharing a message for those who have experienced similar struggles. "To everyone out there who has suffered miscarriages before, there is light on the other side of your journey," she wrote. "You are not alone."</p><p>Waiting for your permission to load the Instagram Media.</p><p>Fans and celebrity pals alike took to the comments section of Alexander's post to offer their congratulations.</p><p>"Yay yay yay!!!

"Last week @alexanderludwig and I had our 3rd miscarriage."</p><p>"I decided I wanted to share because I don't think it's a shameful thing to talk about," she continued. "I want to help others realize how common miscarriages are and how they aren't something to be embarrassed about. Going through this has made me realize, I definitely am not alone. It's so common and yet, I feel it's not talked about nearly enough. If more of us talked about these things, maybe we would feel less alone and at fault. Information is power and I want to start sharing more of it."</p><p>She concluded, "This will forever be a part of our story. My hope by sharing this, if for no other reason, is for that one person reading this to know they are not alone."</p><p>Alexander applauded his wife for her candidness in the comment section of her post, "I'm so proud to call you my wife, you amaze me every day with your resilience strength and just love of life. We got this baby."</p><a id=gallery-link-ea2fdd6c-dd8c-4caa-bbf2-f099978ff4da class="media-link gallery-block__link js-track-link js-click-gallery" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:gallery:ea2fdd6c-dd8c-4caa-bbf2-f099978ff4da data-context='{"name":"gallery-block","section":"permalink"}' data-container-ref=toofab:article:d82d8f6e-62b1-4a13-b32d-125ccd9010e5 data-gallery-layout=carousel><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/a5/4by3/2023/12/21/a5dfc0c297984029974a79315e1b1ff1_md.jpg width=825 height=618 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3R7j2tmamlflrmmxMCnm56qXaHCpcPIoGSwoZaaeq2t1Kucp2WVrb2mr9OipaBlkpavunnAn6ueql2itrSvwKupopmXmsBw</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./gwynne-gilford.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>¬´&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Gwynne Gilford Biography</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./5-spectacular-sapphire-rings-chanel-bulgari-van-cleef-arpels.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;¬ª</span><p class=pager__title>5 spectacular sapphire rings from Chanel, Bulgari, Van Cleef &amp;amp; Arpels, Piaget and Chaumet the bl</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./409878-100-summer-instagram-captions-sunny-funny-html.html>100+ summer Instagram captions that are sunny and funny</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-neck-cream.html>19 Best Neck Creams of 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./angelina-jolie-daughter-vivienne-resembles-brad-pitt-new-photo.html>Angelina Jolie's daughter Vivienne looks just like Brad Pitt in new photo from momentous outing toge</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chicagos-summer-smash-festival-signs-a-ticketing-deal-with-dice.html>Chicagos Summer Smash Festival Signs A Ticketing Deal With DICE</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./fosters-voice-reaching-his-peers-with-organization-of-school-club.html>Foster's Voice reaching his peers with organization of school club</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog.
