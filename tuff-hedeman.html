He began riding in high school and participated with the famed Sul Ross NIRA Championship Team in 1982 in team roping, steer wrestling, bull riding, and bronc riding. Hedeman worked as a professional bull rider from 1983 to 1998. For 11 years, he qualified for the NFR and won the NFR Average in 1987 and 1989.</p><p>He was also 1986, 1989, and 1991 World Champion Bull Rider. Along with his championships, Hedeman co-founded the Professional Bull Riders. He also served as the organization’s president from 1992 to 2004.</p><p>He served as president of the Championship Bull Riding Association from 2005 until 2011. Apart from that, he is well-known for his relationship with the recently deceased Lane Frost.
