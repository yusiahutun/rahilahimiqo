The majority of users don't ever need to touch these files.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Apple keeps certain folders hidden for a reason. Messing with these directories could result in an unstable system, loss of data, or worse—prevent your Mac from booting up. We'll show you the places that most users shouldn't touch in the macOS file system.</p><h2 id=language-files-and-folders>1. Language Files and Folders</h2><p>Mac apps come with language files for every language they support. When you switch your Mac's system language, the app will change to that language immediately.</p><p>To see the language files of an app, Control-click it and choose <strong>Show Package Contents</strong> from the context menu. The path will look like this:<code class=language-bash> AppName.app/Contents/Resources/Lang.lproj</code></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/show-package-contents-of-an-app.png> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Removing the language files for third-party apps is easy through Terminal. But for the default macOS apps, you need to disable System Integrity Protection, which we don't recommend at all.</p><p>Although there is a lot of advice on the internet recommending that you delete language files to regain disk space, the amount of space you earn is not significant enough for the risks involved.</p><p>A quick scan with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored">CleanMyMac</a> shows that my Mac will gain about 520MB of disk space by deleting these files. The result might be different in your case, but it's highly unlikely that you'll gain more than a few gigabytes. Also, you must redo these steps after every major macOS upgrade.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/quick-scan-with-cleanmymac-app.png> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When you remove language files, you can't predict which apps will crash or freeze. In the worst cases, you'll have to reinstall the app. Plus, old versions of programs like Microsoft Office and Adobe apps may not work or update properly. Therefore, it's best to ignore the language files and folders.</p><p>Check out <a href=#>our tips for freeing up space on your Mac</a> for better ways to do this.</p><h2 id=hidden-private-var-folder>2. Hidden /private/var Folder</h2><p>macOS creates several users and system-related cache files to speed up the system. The cache and temporary data located in <strong>/Library/Caches</strong> is under your control. You can <a href=#>manually delete this cache</a> without any third-party tools.</p><p>But the files in the system folder are entirely managed by macOS. They're not even visible to you. Sometimes items in these directories can take up vast amounts of disk space. Thus, you might wonder whether it's safe to delete the contents of <strong>/private/var/folders</strong> or not.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>How to See Hidden Files on Your Mac</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h3 id=location-of-private-var-folders>Location of /private/var/folders</h3><p>The simplest way to find the <strong>/private/var</strong> folder is through the Finder <strong>Go to Folder</strong> menu. Press <strong>Cmd + Shift + G</strong> to bring up the <strong>Go to Folder</strong> box and enter <strong>/private/var/folders</strong>. A new Finder tab will open immediately.</p><p>To open the location of system cached and temporary files, launch a <strong>Terminal</strong> window and type the following:<code class=language-bash> open $TMPDIR</code> You'll see a two-character folder name with long, seemingly random subfolder names. As you navigate the folder tree, explore these three folders. The <strong>C</strong> folder represents <strong>Cache</strong>, while <strong>T</strong> is for <strong>Temporary</strong> files. <strong>User</strong> files live in the <strong>0</strong> folder.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/location-of-private-var-folder.png> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h3 id=issues-with-private-var-folders>Issues With /private/var/folders</h3><p>A quick scan with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">OmniDiskSweeper</a> shows that the size of <strong>/private/var/folders</strong> is about 1GB and that of <strong>/private/var</strong> is about 4GB. The size of these folders can vary between system, but shouldn't be too large.</p><p>If these directories take up more than 10GB, then they're a concern.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/results-of-omnidisksweeper-app.png><p>You should not attempt to manually delete files from any of the <strong>/private/var</strong> directories, even if they're large. Doing so might damage core macOS files, corrupt document data, and prevent your Mac from booting or behaving as expected. You'd then be stuck reinstalling macOS from scratch.</p><p>To safely remove these files, quit all apps, shut down your Mac. When you reboot your Mac, you trigger the built-in cache clearing mechanisms. This deletes the unnecessary contents, caches, and temporary items in <strong>/tmp</strong>, <strong>/private/var</strong>, and <strong>/private/var/folders</strong>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>If, for some reason, these files don't clear, then <a href=#>reboot your Mac in Safe Mode</a>. macOS deploys additional built-in mechanisms to get rid of caches and temporary files in this mode. Then reboot into normal mode as usual and recheck your available disk space.</p><h3 id=other-important-folders-in-private-var>Other Important Folders in /private/var</h3><p>Concerning disk space, there are few more folders that you should not touch:</p><ul><li><strong>/private/var/db:</strong> Includes a bunch of macOS configuration and data files. They include Spotlight database, network configuration files, and more.</li><li><strong>/private/var/VM</strong><strong>:</strong> Contains swap and sleep image files. If you hibernate your Mac, this directory will occupy more than 5GB of disk space.</li><li><strong>/private/var/tmp:</strong> Another temporary file directory.</li></ul><h2 id=system-library-folder>3. System Library Folder</h2><p>The macOS file system contains multiple Library folders. This is intentional, and while many similarities exist between the contents of the Library folders, each folder has a different role to play in the macOS file system. You'll find three Library folders:</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><ul><li><strong>/Library</strong></li><li><strong>/System/Library</strong></li><li><strong>~/Library</strong></li></ul><p>The main Library and System Library folder have a global scope. Their contents support every aspect of the system. The System Library folder contains the files that macOS needs to operate. Only the OS has the right to modify its data, and only system-level events should affect them. There's no reason for you to touch anything in this folder.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/system-library-folder.png><h2 id=user-library-folder>4. User Library Folder</h2><p>The <strong>Library</strong> folder inside the home directory is your account's personal Library. Here, macOS stores system, third-party support, and preferences files. It also includes Mail settings, Safari bookmarks, browsing history data, calendar data, and much more. The Library folder also includes folders that need occasional cleaning. However, not all folders are safe to touch.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h3 id=library-application-support>~/Library/Application Support</h3><p>In this folder, both system and third-party apps store support files, usually in a subfolder named after the relevant application. They contain registration data and even store saved app data used in a particular session. Do not delete contents of the Application Support files directly. Instead, use an app called <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">AppCleaner</a> to delete support files along with the app.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/library-application-support-folder.png><h3 id=library-preferences>~/Library/Preferences</h3><p>This folder contains all the preference data for default and third-party apps. Again, don't delete the contents of the <strong>Preferences</strong> folder; otherwise, an app will revert to its default state or might crash. AppCleaner will take care of preferences while uninstalling an app.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/library-preferences-folder.png><h3 id=library-mobile-documents>~/Library/Mobile Documents</h3><p>This is the actual location of the iCloud folder. Documents, application preference files, iOS app data, and more live in this folder. You should not move, rename, or delete it. It's also a folder that takes up a lot of disk space if you use iCloud. Delete the files you don't need from iCloud Drive to reduce its size.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/library-mobile-documents-folder.png> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h3 id=library-containers>~/Library/Containers</h3><p>This contains support files, cached data, and temporary files for apps you've downloaded from the Mac App Store. Since apps on the App Store are sandboxed, they cannot write data anywhere on the system. Again, don't delete the contents of this folder. If the Containers folder takes up a lot of disk space, reinstall the affected app.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/library-containers-folder.png><h2 id=hidden-folders-in-the-home-folder>5. Hidden Folders in the Home Folder</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/hidden-folders-in-finder.jpg><p>When you press the <strong>Cmd + Shift + Period</strong> keys in the Finder, you'll see plenty of files and folders in the <strong>Home</strong> directory that are typically hidden from view. Different macOS technologies and apps store their data in these folders for the smooth working of your Mac. You should not modify or delete any of these folders:</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><ul><li><strong>.Spotlight-V100:</strong> Spotlight metadata for each mounted volume. The <strong>mdworker</strong> processes use this metadata to update Spotlight search.</li><li><strong>.fseventsd:</strong> A log file of FSEvents logged by the <strong>fseventsd launchdaemon</strong> process. It monitors file system events, such as file creation, modification, deletion, and more. Time Machine uses this data to process backups in the background.</li><li><strong>.DocumentRevisions-V100:</strong> A macOS versioning database used by apps to save and retrieve different versions of a document.</li><li><strong>.PKInstallSandboxManager:</strong> Used for software updates and sandboxing.</li><li><strong>.PKInstallSandboxManager-SystemSoftware:</strong> Used for system software updates.</li><li><strong>.Trashes:</strong> Trash folder in each mounted volume.</li></ul><h2 id=steer-clear-of-important-macos-folders>Steer Clear of Important macOS Folders</h2><p>Messing with these folders is risky, as doing so might corrupt your apps, documents, and macOS. While most Mac users don't have to worry about these folders, you might be tempted to start exploring these folders when disk space becomes an issue.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In cases like that, having a backup is essential, so that if you lose any data, you can recover it relatively easily. Thankfully, your Mac already has tons of ways to help you with this.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3KnqysnZ%2Bbe6S7zGirmp9foq6kecWoo52doqh6r7HVnqlmrJ%2BqsKl7</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./amirah-kassem-ross-harrow-flour-shop-wedding.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Amirah Kassem and Ross Harrow's Wedding in Mexico</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./yvette-de-leon.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Who Is Scottie Pippens Daughter Taylor Pippen?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./409878-100-summer-instagram-captions-sunny-funny-html.html>100+ summer Instagram captions that are sunny and funny</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-neck-cream.html>19 Best Neck Creams of 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./angelina-jolie-daughter-vivienne-resembles-brad-pitt-new-photo.html>Angelina Jolie's daughter Vivienne looks just like Brad Pitt in new photo from momentous outing toge</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chicagos-summer-smash-festival-signs-a-ticketing-deal-with-dice.html>Chicagos Summer Smash Festival Signs A Ticketing Deal With DICE</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./fosters-voice-reaching-his-peers-with-organization-of-school-club.html>Foster's Voice reaching his peers with organization of school club</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog.
