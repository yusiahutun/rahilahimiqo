Andy has telepathic powers, while his daughter, Charlie, is a powerful pyrokinetic who can set ablaze any area in a matter of seconds. “I play the dad, and Ryan plays my daughter Charlie, and then my wife is played by Sydney Lemmon,” Efron, who plays Andy, told <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Entertainment Weekly</a> in May 2022. “We are working with our daughter as she is developing these supernatural pyrokinetic abilities. She’s got these emotional triggers that cause her to set things on fire, and it’s a superpower that’s sort of not really developed, and we don’t know whether to keep her from using it or to encourage her to learn how to use it. There’s a government agency that’s after her to use her in nefarious ways, turn her into a weapon of some sort.”</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/where-harvey-weinstein-now.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/disney-plus-free-trial.jpg><p>The role is also the first time Efron—who has starred in movies like <a href=# rel=noopener>High School Musical</a>, Baywatch and Neighbors—has played a dad. “I didn’t think about it all that much,” Efron told Ellen DeGeneres in a May 2022 episode of The Ellen DeGeneres Show about playing a parent for the first time. “And then when we started filming the movie, I had a two-week quarantine … and when I got out of quarantine, we started filming that Monday, so it was a pretty quick intro to the film, and all of a sudden I had this daughter in front of me.” He continued, “We had a pretty heavy dad-daughter scene right off the bat, and I realized I was drastically underprepared for this part. I didn’t know what I was doing.”</p><p>Though Efron had a great time starring with his on-screen daughter, <span class=s3>Ryan Kiera Armstrong, he confirmed to DeGeneres that Firestarter hasn’t inspired him to have his own kids any time soon. “I think that was a healthy dose to put me off for as long as necessary. I have a little bit more growing to do, probably,” he said.</span></p><p>So…where can fans stream Firestarter if they can’t make it to the theater?
