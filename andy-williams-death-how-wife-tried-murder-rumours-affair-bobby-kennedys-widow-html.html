But Andy Williams had a knack for making the most unlikely tales sound like ‘downhome’ truths - a knack that would serve him well.</span></p><p><span>Yet his carefully cultivated, squeaky-clean image hid an extraordinary, often scandalous story.</span></p><p><span>His singing career began in Wall Lake’s Presbyterian church, where Andy and his older brothers, Richard, Robert and Donald, sang in the choir. Their father promoted them as close harmony singers to radio producers in Des Moines, Iowa’s capital.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Jay was a hard taskmaster. ‘You have to practise harder,’ he told his sons over and over, ‘because you’re not as good as the others out there.’</span></p><p><span>By the early Forties, the family had moved to Los Angeles, in the hope the boys could break into Hollywood.</span></p><p><span>They caught the ear of crooner Bing Crosby, then America’s biggest-selling singer, who picked them as the backing group for his 1944 hit Swinging On A Star, which went on to win an Oscar for Best Original Song.</span></p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2012/09/26/article-2208898-1537C080000005DC-436_634x378.jpg height=378 width=634 alt="From the beginning: Andy Williams gets a hug from Wayne Osmond as he appears on stage alongside the group including Donny (right) in 2007.

The Osmonds launched their career on Williams' variety show</p><p><span>It was an impressive way to launch a career, but Williams, by now 16, immediately went one better - his voice was chosen to dub the husky tones of 19-year-old Lauren Bacall in her debut film, To Have And Have Not.</span></p><p><span>Director Howard Hawks insisted that the song, How Little We Know, was eventually performed by Bacall herself in the final cut. Williams would never confirm that he’d been ousted; he just gave his slow smile and said ‘Maybe’, giving everyone the impression he was the real star.</span></p><p><span>After the war, the brothers teamed up with comedienne Kay Thompson, and despite an 18-year age gap, the 22-year-old Williams and Kay began a long affair.<br></span></p><p><span>Kay, best remembered for her role opposite Audrey Hepburn as the acerbic fashion editor in Funny Face, promoted his career ceaselessly.</span></p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2012/09/26/article-2208898-1537C0F8000005DC-807_306x423.jpg height=423 width=306 alt="Life in showbusiness: Williams, pictured in 2008, received 18 gold and three platinum albums over his long career and was nominated for five Grammys" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Life in showbusiness: Williams, pictured in 2008, received 18 gold and three platinum albums over his long career and was nominated for five Grammys</p><p><span>But it wasn’t a quick path to stardom. After his brothers quit the business to raise families, Andy soldiered on, sometimes earning so little that he was reduced to eating dog food. ‘It tasted damned good,’ he claimed.</span></p><p><span>Regular spots on U.S. television’s Tonight Show, engineered for him by Thompson, finally gave him hits - first as a rock ’n’ roller, shaking his hips like Elvis Presley, and then as a crooner. Though the laidback, easy-listening style was already out-of-date, it suited his voice and his personality. He was a born family entertainer.</span></p><p><span>But his private life was far raunchier than his mild-mannered singing would lead you to believe. He married a showgirl, was accused of an affair with a Kennedy and found himself embroiled in a murder trial which caused a media frenzy.</span></p><p><span>In 1960, Williams was driving through Las Vegas when he spotted a young woman beside a broken-down car at the side of the road. He stopped to help, and was immediately smitten by the 18-year-old, French-born showgirl, Claudine Longet. With her wide mouth and dark, curling hair, she was breathtakingly beautiful - admirers used words like ‘ethereal’ and ‘exquisite’.</span></p><p><span>They married a year later, and throughout the Sixties the couple were at the heart of the showbiz party circuit - with singer Barbra Streisand, Senator Bobby Kennedy and astronaut John Glenn among their close friends.</span></p><p><span>Williams’s career had gone stratospheric. He had one big advantage over the older generation of crooners like Sinatra and Perry Como - they were baritones, but he possessed a lighter, tenor voice, making it closer to the prevailing pop sound.</span></p><p><span>As Beatlemania swept America, Williams had his own prime-time TV show, top billing at Caesar’s Palace in Vegas and a string of Gold albums. His signature tune was Henry Mancini’s Moon River, made famous by another Hepburn film, Breakfast At Tiffany’s.</span></p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2012/09/26/article-2208898-1537ACF2000005DC-183_634x489.jpg height=489 width=634 alt="Famous friends: (left to right) Frank Sinatra, Charles Young and Andy Williams" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Famous friends: (left to right) Frank Sinatra, Charles Young and Andy Williams</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2012/09/26/article-2208898-1537ABEB000005DC-624_306x423.jpg height=423 width=306 alt="Resolute performer: Williams (pictured in 1972, left) began his singing career at eight years old alongside his brothers and rose to global fame.

All were movie songs: Williams knew the cinema was a better vehicle for his voice even than TV.</span></p><p><span>The savvy Williams believed his own star would shine the brighter if he surrounded himself with other luminaries, so instead of hogging the airtime on his own show, he brought on a cavalcade of guests. He discovered The Osmonds, first as a group of four brothers and later with a nine-year-old Donny.</span></p><p><span>Simon and Garfunkel, the Jacksons, Julie Andrews and Woody Allen all clamoured to appear with the man that Las Vegas now hailed as ‘the Emperor of Smooth’.</span></p><p><span>When Robert Kennedy, brother of the murdered president Jack, was campaigning for the nomination as Democrat candidate for the White House in 1968, Andy and Claudine were among his closest supporters.</span></p><p><span>At the Ambassador Hotel in LA, Williams was dressing in his room and watching Kennedy — who was in the lobby downstairs — on TV talking to reporters, when a man stepped out of the crowd and shot Kennedy three times. A stricken Williams, who had heard the shots on his television, rushed to the hospital where his friend lay on a bed, soaked in blood.</span></p><p><span>Friends brought fresh clothes to dress the body, but had forgotten a tie. Williams took off his own and offered it to Bobby’s widow, Ethel. 'I was putting that on when I heard the shots,' he said.</span></p><p><span>At the funeral in New York, Williams sang The Battle Hymn Of The Republic, and as his voice was broadcast outside St Patrick’s Cathedral, thousands of mourners lining the streets joined in.</span></p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2012/09/26/article-2208898-1537BBAF000005DC-941_306x423.jpg height=423 width=306 alt="Great loves: Andy Williams with his first wife Claudine Longet (left) and second wife Debb (right)" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto> <img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2012/09/26/article-2208898-1537A980000005DC-697_306x423.jpg height=423 width=306 alt="Great loves: Andy Williams with his first wife Claudine Longet (left) and second wife Debbie (right)" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Great loves: Andy Williams with his first wife Claudine Longet (left) and second wife Debbie (right)</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2012/09/26/article-2208898-1537C1CD000005DC-918_634x505.jpg height=505 width=634 alt="Star attraction: Andy Williams announces the winner of Song Of The Year at the 50th Grammy Awards along with Nelly Furtado (left) and actress Roselyn Sanchez" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Star attraction: Andy Williams announces the winner of Song Of The Year at the 50th Grammy Awards along with Nelly Furtado (left) and actress Roselyn Sanchez</p><p><span>Williams’s own politics remained an enigma. Despite his friendship with the Kennedys, he gave the impression of being an arch-conservative and Republican. In later years, he accused Barack Obama of being a Marxist. But when John Lennon was being hounded by the FBI, Williams campaigned staunchly to allow the ex-Beatle to stay in America.</span></p><p><span>He and Claudine had three children; the youngest, born in 1969, was named Bobby, in homage to his murdered friend.<br></span></p><p><span>But the marriage hit the rocks, partly because of persistent rumours linking Williams with Bobby’s widow, Ethel.</span></p><p><span>He always insisted, in his measured drawl, that he and Ethel were simply friends, just as they had been when her husband was alive.</span></p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2012/09/27/article-2209211-153A0AA2000005DC-742_634x396.jpg height=396 width=634 alt="Alleged affair: Williams' marriage to Claudine was on the rocks due to persistent rumours linking Williams with Bobby Kennedy's widow, Ethel, above" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Alleged affair: Williams' marriage to Claudine was on the rocks due to persistent rumours linking Williams with Bobby Kennedy's widow, Ethel, above</p><p><span>Claudine, meanwhile, was deeply involved with a champion skier, Spider Sabich, an Olympic medallist and infamous party animal.</span></p><p><span>Her singing career, which had produced a dozen minor chart hits, floundered, and she Williams divorced in 1975. Wild living had tarnished both her looks and voice.<br></span></p><p><span>Then, in the bathroom of a ski chalet in Aspen, Colorado, Claudine shot Spider in the stomach with a .22 pistol. He died in the ambulance on the way to hospital.</span></p><h3 class=wocc><span style=font-weight:700>THE MAGIC OF MOON RIVER</span><br></h3><p><span>Despite a long catalogue of hits, the song for which Andy Williams will forever be remembered is the timeless Moon River.</span></p><p><span>Written by Henry Mancini and Johnny Mercer in 1961, it was originally composed for the movie Breakfast At Tiffany's to be sung by Audrey Hepburn's character Holly Golightly.</span><span><br></span></p><p><span>In the same year, Moon River won the Academy Award for Best Original Song. It was performed at the Oscars in 1962 by Williams who quickly became identified with the track.</span></p><p><span>Although he never released it as a single, Williams' album Moon River And Other Great Movie Themes was certified gold in 1963 after grossing $1million in sales.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>In 1992, he opened a theatre in Branson, Missouri, named after his famous song.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Andy Williams' biography, Moon River And Me, was published in October 2009.&nbsp;<br></span></p><p><span>The subsequent murder trial was a cause celebre. Aspen was one of America’s celebrity hotspots: Jack Nicholson and John Denver owned neighbouring chalets.</span></p><p><span>Rumours swirled that a blood sample taken from Claudine showed signs of cocaine use but, because of procedural errors by police, the evidence was inadmissible in court.</span></p><p><span>Andy Williams appeared in court to testify on behalf of his ex-wife, and many believed that his testimony, in the face of damning circumstantial evidence, saved her from a long prison sentence.</span></p><p><span>In the event, her plea that the gun had gone off accidentally was accepted and she was found guilty only of criminal negligence. She served just 30 days in jail.</span></p><p><span>‘I had to be there for her,’ Williams said. ‘She is the mother of my children. I accept her story, I think she is telling the truth.’</span></p><p><span>Others took a more cynical view. The Rolling Stones recorded a scabrous song, simply called Claudine, for their album Emotional Rescue in 1980: 'Only Spider knows for sure,’ sang Mick Jagger, ‘but he ain’t talking about it any more.’ Under legal pressure, the band dropped the song before the album’s release.</span></p><p><span>In 1991, Williams married again, this time to a woman 30 years his junior, Debbie Meyer.
