Hartley stars as Kevin Pearson on the NBC drama series, which premiered in September 2016. The show, which is in its fifth season, follows a family of five from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in two timelines: the 1980s when the Pearson siblings (Kevin, Randall, Kate) are kids and modern day when they’re adults.</p><p>Along with This Is Us, fans may also remember Hartley from his marriage to Selling Sunset star <a href=# id=auto-tag_chrishell-stause data-tag=chrishell-stause>Chrishell Stause</a>.&nbsp;Hartley <a href=#>filed for the divorce</a> from the reality TV star in November 2019 after barely two years of marriage. Although news of the divorce broke in November 2019, the <a href=#>This Is Us&nbsp;actor</a> claimed that the couple’s separation was actually on July 8, 2019, nearly four months before he filed. Stause, however, claims that they separated on November 22 of that year—the same day Hartley “shocked” her by filing for divorce.</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Outlander.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Outlander.jpg><p>Season 3 of Selling Sunset, which premiered on Netflix in August 2020, saw Stause at the center of the drama after being “blindsided” by the divorce. In a teaser clip for <a href=#>Selling Sunset</a> at the time, the Kentucky native revealed that Hartley texted her about the decision just moments before news of the split leaked to media outlets. “He texted me that we were filed,” she says tearfully in the clip. “Forty-five minutes later the world knew.”</p><p>To this day, fans are still curious about Hartley’s decision, with plenty wondering why he would claim the date of separation as July 8, 2020 given his “sudden” filing to Stause in November. Did something happen in the four months leading up to this? TMZ&nbsp;believes it’s possible that <a href=# id=auto-tag_justin-hartley data-tag=justin-hartley>Justin Hartley</a>‘s net worth had plenty to do with the decision. Following the split, the outlet reported in December 2019 that Justin Hartley’s net worth had just gotten a big boost thanks to&nbsp;This Is Us. They speculate the reason for listing his separate date months earlier was to avoid his new salary from the NBC series from being considered in their divorce. Which, could very well be a major worry for the star, considering that it’s unclear if he and Stause ever signed a prenup.</p><p>For everything we know about Justin Hartley’s net worth in 2022—from his current salary on This Is Us,&nbsp;to how his divorce from Chrishell Stause might’ve impacted it—just keep on reading.</p><h2>How much does Justin Hartley make from This Is Us?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/this-is-us-season-4.jpg><p>Justin Hartley’s net worth has seen its biggest growth thanks to his role as Kevin Pearson on This Is Us.

He went on to have a similar role on&nbsp;The Young and the Restless&nbsp;between 2014 and 2016.</p><h2>Did Justin Hartley and Chrishell Stause have a prenup?</h2><p>It remains unclear if Justin Hartley’s net worth was negatively impacted by his divorce from Chrishell Stause, but it’s entirely a possibility.
