Not <a href=#>Stevie Nicks</a>, though. The <a href=#>Fleetwood Mac</a> artist that while there’s a chance she eventually pens an autobiography, it likely won’t happen for a long time. She explained why she thinks any book about her life would anger people and why she has to wait to write a book until nobody cares.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Stevie-Nicks-15.jpg><h2 id=h-in-the-70s-stevie-nicks-and-lindsey-buckingham-ended-their-relationship>In the ’70s, Stevie Nicks and Lindsey Buckingham ended their relationship</h2><p id=par-2_43>After moving to Los Angeles and producing an album together, Nicks and Lindsey Buckingham joined Fleetwood Mac. Their later breakup was part of the inspiration for Fleetwood Mac’s album,&nbsp;Rumours. Following the messy split from Buckingham, Nicks went on to date several other musicians.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" id=emb-2 readability=2><p>https://twitter.com/ThatEricAlper/status/1425849740839858176</p></figure><p id=par-3_79>She had a relationship with Don Henley and Joe Walsh of The Eagles. Nicks would later describe Walsh as the “<a href=#>great, great love</a>” of her life. She also had an affair with Fleetwood Mac drummer Mick Fleetwood, which further snarled band relations when they ended things. In 1983, she had&nbsp;<a href=#>a regrettable marriage</a>&nbsp;to her friend’s widower. She later explained that the union wasn’t born out of love but of grief and a desire to care for her friend’s infant son.</p><h2 id=h-she-won-t-write-a-memoir-just-yet>She won’t write a memoir just yet</h2><p id=par-4_47>These relationships and Nicks’ expertise in navigating the entertainment industry have many people hoping that she’ll write a memoir. Unfortunately, they’ll have to wait. In an interview with&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Billboard</a>, Nicks said that she can’t write a memoir now because she “wouldn’t be able to tell the whole truth.”</p><p id=par-5_57>“The world is not ready for my memoir, I guarantee you,” she explained, “All of the men I hung out with are on their third wives by now, and the wives are all under 30. If I were to write what really happened between 1972 and now, a lot of people would be very angry with me.”</p><p id=par-6_10>Specifically, she worries about disrupting any relationships with her writing.</p><p id=par-7_14>“The third wives are not ready. The husbands are not ready either,” she said.</p><p id=par-8_30>Still, there’s a chance that Nicks will eventually gift the world with her uncensored memoir. She just wants to wait until “everybody is so old that they no longer care.”</p><p id=par-9_49>“I am loyal to a fault,” she said. “And I have a certain loyalty to these people that I love because I do love them, and I will always love them. I cannot throw any of them under the bus until I absolutely know that they will not care.”</p><p id=par-10_18>With those words, though, it sounds like whatever she has to share would make for a good book.</p><h2 id=h-stevie-nicks-drug-use-is-something-she-would-gracefully-cover>Stevie Nicks’ drug use is something she would ‘gracefully’ cover</h2><p id=par-11_21>Though she doesn’t have current plans for a book, Nicks has a good idea of how she would cover certain topics.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-12_30>“‘I would very gracefully go over the drugs.
