I’ve fielded enough breakdown phone calls and late night texts to glean this reality, yet the number of stunning women with effortlessly-gorgeous packs of children filling my Instagram feed would suggest otherwise. Frolicking through sprawling fields or floating in oceans around the globe, their wavy hair is always perfectly-tousled, their sun-drenched homes are unfailing immaculate, and their wardrobes are full of clothes we all want to be wearing. They have hundreds of thousands of followers and their bios read: mom. (Or, very often, "mama.")</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=1 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“When did a baby become the coolest accessory a woman can have?” asked one of my friends, her baby in one arm, a dirty diaper in the other. “It’s like all the cool girls grew up, had really cool babies, and they all have beautiful Instagram accounts to prove it.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The concept of aspirational motherhood is nothing new—from fictional characters like Carol Brady and Clair Huxtable to the glass ceiling-shattering likes of Marisa Mayer, popular culture has continually pushed society's ideal of the supermom—but a new breed of social media-savvy women are beginning to reject their generation's long-sought after power mom paradigm of working full-time to pursue a career with nannies on the clock. Instead, they’re embracing their role as mothers, reclaiming the title for themselves as they start businesses of their own—all while making it look really, really good.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=3 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Margaret Kleveland is one of these mothers. The 36-year-old launched her California-based clothing line <a href=# data-external=true data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://shopdoen.com/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Dôen class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Dôen</a> with her sister Katherine when her son was just three weeks old. The brand, which bills itself as elevated yet wearable pieces for the everyday, focuses most of its content on incredibly beautiful, bohemian mothers, with their equally beautiful children. “I was having conflicting feelings about what my life as a mother was going to look like, working in a hugely competitive industry that expects most people to hold down 10-hour days with limited flexibility to work remotely, or work around the obligations of being a mother,” explains Kleveland, who spent eight years building a career in footwear before launching <span class=redactor-unlink>Dôen</span>. “In retrospect it feels like a completely insane decision but there was something about being a new mom that gave me the courage to leap.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><span class=redactor-unlink>Dôen</span>’s dreamy <a href=# data-external=true data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.instagram.com/shopdoen/?hl=en" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Instagram photos" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Instagram photos</a> of mothers in stunning settings (think: fields of tall grass and ocean-scapes) are part of what <a href=# data-external=true data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://www.mothermag.com/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Mother Mag" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Mother Mag</a> co-founder, James Kicinski-McCoy—whose own Instagram account, <a href=# data-external=true data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.instagram.com/bleubird/?hl=en" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=@bleubird class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">@bleubird</a>, boasts 248,000 followers—calls “the new mom space”.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“Social media has given women, especially mothers, a new outlook on career and motherhood,” explains Kicinski-McCoy, who launched Mother Mag—a full-service, stylish parenting site—in 2014 with Katie Hintz-Zambrano. “For the first time ever, more women in their 30s are having children than women in their 20s and teens. Many of these women are passionate about being mothers. It’s not something they want to outsource or downplay.”</p><img alt="Photograph, Dress, Wedding dress, Adaptation, Summer, Photography, Companion dog, Bridal clothing, Wildflower, Bride, " title="Photograph, Dress, Wedding dress, Adaptation, Summer, Photography, Companion dog, Bridal clothing, Wildflower, Bride, " width=2000 height=913 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/hbz-instagram-moms-01-1506440825.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Photos from left: courtesy of Courtney Adamo, James Branaman, Jordan Rebello</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Indeed, the average age of first-time mothers continues to increase, with first births among women over age 30 rising 51 percent, and first births to women younger than age 20 declining 42 percent, according to a <a href=# data-external=true data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/databriefs/db232.pdf data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="2016 report" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">2016 report</a> from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Center for Health Statistics. Rather than return to their day jobs, many women are opting instead to “get creative with what ‘work’ can look like,” says Hintz-Zambrano. Increasingly, that “work” turns out to be of the entrepreneurial sort, with new mothers starting businesses of their own.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“A lot of women just aren’t into the idea of going to work for someone else, especially at the hours previously demanded of them, when they know they would be losing precious time with their kids," explains Hintz-Zambrano, who recently launched <a href=# data-external=true data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://beingoodcompany.co/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="In Good Company" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">In Good Company</a>, a conference for creative, entrepreneurial mothers. "Ponying up for childcare when you lose all of that time with your children and you’re not necessarily taking home much more than the childcare provider doesn’t seem like the best situation.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">For these entrepreneurial women, social media is a key tool in promoting the growth of a new business—which today, often means promoting yourself and your lifestyle. Being a mother is a big part of that lifestyle, so it makes sense that their identity as a mother becomes a part of their marketing strategy.</p><img alt="Text, Font, Line, Happy, " title="Text, Font, Line, Happy, " width=2000 height=2038 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/hbz-instagram-moms-pq-02-1506443530.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">.</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Women like Courtney Adamo (<a href=# data-external=true data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.instagram.com/courtneyadamo/?hl=en" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=@courtneyadamo class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">@courtneyadamo</a>, mom-of-five, 226,000 followers), Jordan Rebello (<a href=# data-external=true data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.instagram.com/bigsecret/?hl=en" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=@bigsecret class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">@bigsecret</a>, mom-of-one, 17,000 followers), Taylor Sterling, (<a href=# data-external=true data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.instagram.com/taylorsterling/?hl=en" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=@taylorsterling class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">@taylorsterling</a>, mom-of-two, 138,000 followers), Christy Dawn Petersen (<a href=# data-external=true data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.instagram.com/crittycat00/?hl=en" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=@crittycat00 class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">@crittycat00</a>, mom-of-one, 21,000 followers), and Julie D.

Yet to the average spectator, their aesthetically-pleasing, often curated images can appear effortlessly beautiful. Which, as a woman who eventually wants to have children, raises the question: “Is this really what motherhood looks like?”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Blake Lively raised this question on <a href=# data-external=true data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDV0qjAxbm4" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Late Night with Seth Meyers" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Late Night with Seth Meyers</a> during her second pregnancy. “There’s a lady on Instagram who I used to love to watch...she just made having a baby look lovely," Lively explained to Meyers. "Everything is white and she always has a fresh blueberry pie that’s steaming, and scones and clotted cream, and she’s reading Old Man And The Sea. Her little baby… is just, like, sleeping while knitting… and her toddler is like giving her a reflexology massage.

A quick scroll through <a href=# data-external=true data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.instagram.com/brass__tacks/?hl=en" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="my own account" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">my own account</a> yields a collection of hyper-photogenic, cherry-picked slices of my life: me floating through the desert-scape of Joshua Tree in a gauzy dress! Me walking away from the camera in perfect-fitting Levis! Photo brags of my husband, our home, and our travels, all sprinkled with a few sponsored posts. The influence these images can have on shaping another woman’s world view—and perhaps not for the better—is something I often think about. For Kleveland, <span class=redactor-unlink>Dôen</span>’s “ultra dreamlike, tender images of women and their children” are something she and her sister love sharing, but they try to be aware of the way their company represents working moms.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“We have the opportunity to be transparent about the way that we are able to incorporate kids into our work lives,” she says, adding, “my sister and I do have our kids in the office sometimes...but we also have a support network of nannies and caregivers. We are in no way living a life that is part of the common social media ‘look at my beautiful family, great house, and all of my stuff’ illusion. I really feel strongly about avoiding that precious and unrealistic representation of motherhood,” she says.</p><img alt="Text, Font, Line, Happy, Photo caption, Black-and-white, " title="Text, Font, Line, Happy, Photo caption, Black-and-white, " width=2000 height=2826 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/hbz-instagram-moms-pq-01-1506443560.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">.</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Courtney Adamo, co-founder of <a href=# data-external=true data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://babyccinokids.com/shop/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Babyccino Kids" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Babyccino Kids</a> who has five kids under the age of 12, argues that social media doesn’t differ much from traditional media sources like magazines and television, where the majority of what you see is the “polished, styled, pretty side of things”. Like most of us, she treats her Instagram account as a place to share what makes her happy—a place to document her children’s milestones and a place to inspire and gather inspiration. “I am not motivated to get my phone out and snap photos when my kids are arguing or when I’m feeling stressed with work or when the baby is screaming in the car on a long drive. I’m not opposed to sharing these things, but it’s just not something I think to photograph or document at the time”.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Adamo has her own strategy for keeping things authentic on her feed. “Often when I’m sharing photos I have my parents or my siblings in mind. Instagram is a way to share our family’s daily adventures. I’m not trying to impress them but rather to share a glimpse of our lives here on the opposite side of the world.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Candice Miller, co-founder of <a href=# data-external=true data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://www.mamaandtata.com/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Mama and Tata" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Mama and Tata</a>, an online resource for New York-based mothers, agrees that social media has become something akin to a digital magazine, and treats her Instagram account <a href=# data-external=true data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.instagram.com/mamaandtata/?hl=en" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=@mamaandtata class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">@mamaandtata</a> as such, using her content and the app's story feature as an opportunity to highlight the reality of being a mom. “I try not to sugarcoat real issues, and am expressive when I'm having a difficult time or seeking help in a particular area of motherhood,” she says. “This is my brand, my business, my creation, so it is important to me that it be both aspirational and inspirational to my followers.”</p><img alt="Clothing, Lingerie, Undergarment, Photography, Underpants, Thigh, " title="Clothing, Lingerie, Undergarment, Photography, Underpants, Thigh, " width=2000 height=913 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/hbz-instagram-moms-02-1506440789.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Photos from left: courtesy of Doen, Tori Praver, Doen</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Miller also raises an important point: social media, with all of its faults for creating a varnished image of motherhood, has helped forge a virtual community that allows moms to network, connect, and relate to one another. “For a long time, motherhood and its challenges made women feel alone and isolated," she says. "Now there is an open forum to stay in touch and make light of our ‘mom fails.'" This is something that mother-to-be Hannah Morrill, a New York-based freelance writer and editor, can relate to. Morrill, who is expecting her first child in early October, began following a handful of mama-centric Instagram accounts after she found out she was pregnant, and says she enjoys the authenticity in many of the captions that accompany the beautifully-composed images. “Maybe my life has enough real realness that I don't need it on my Instagram feed—these polished images balanced with honest captions are a soothing tonic."<span></span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Mother-of-three and art director Elaina Bellis (<a href=# data-external=true data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.instagram.com/laylaygibson/?hl=en" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=@laylaygobson class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">@laylaygobson</a>) is especially known for her honesty on social media. After suffering a stillbirth in 2014, she shared her heartbreaking experience on Instagram. Similarly, an intimate post about her struggles with <a href=# data-external=true data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.instagram.com/p/BEG4-_zOPDk/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="breastfeeding " class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">breastfeeding </a>went viral last year. Bellis, who has over 30,000 Instagram followers, admits to struggling with how to maintain a sense of authenticity when companies ask to work with her through sponsored posts.<br></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=24 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“That aspect of Instagram is tough,” she confesses. Both she and her husband are freelancers, and these sponsored posts are a source of income for their family. “We might not have been able to afford twins without them…I just do my best to keep it organic and genuine to me.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=25 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Taylor Sterling, the founder of <a href=# data-external=true data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://theglitterguide.com/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Glitter Guide" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Glitter Guide</a>, a popular lifestyle website for women, also recognizes the challenges—and pitfalls—of the Instagram-ification of motherhood.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=26 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“There is a lot of new research that’s coming out about social media and how it affects us. I know that as a creative director and someone who really loves artistic things, I can get trapped into posting only pretty things, or things that look cohesive with my ‘brand,’” says Sterling, whose Instagram account <a href=# data-external=true data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.instagram.com/taylorsterling/?hl=en" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=@taylorsterling class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">@taylorsterling</a> boasts 138,000 followers, attests to the complexity of today's three-way marriage: motherhood, business and social media. “Nowadays, we working moms want to brand ourselves as businesses but not ignore that we are mothers. I know for me and my Instagram account, I start off with ‘mom’ first since it's such a huge part of who I am. I’m not ashamed to be a mom entrepreneur and I want my audience to know they will see a mix of my business and my life as a mom on my account.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=27 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Kicinski-McCoy echoes the importance of accountability when portraying motherhood on social media. “I think influencers have a responsibility to keep things real much of the time and take a step back from portraying that everything is roses,” she says. “Motherhood is hard and dirty and no one has their shit together 100 percent of the time. It’s okay to show a perfectly-kept home where the beds are made, all of the toys are put away, and your happy kids are dressed in Sunday’s best, but I personally find it refreshing to see the other side—piles of laundry, dishes in the sink, mac and cheese or cereal for dinner (because that happens sometimes)—and moments of weakness.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=28 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In the end, these women are doing exactly what I’m doing with my own Instagram account—but they have the added responsibility of supporting a family. Or, as New York-based mother-of-one Senami d’Almeida put it, “These women who have multiple children and make it look good make me feel happy about motherhood. And if it’s paying their bills, more power to them." She paused, adding: "Motherhood and work-life balance on their own terms.
