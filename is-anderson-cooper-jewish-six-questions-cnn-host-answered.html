One of his major Jewish scandals played out in August 2019, putting him at loggerheads with the former POTUS Donald Trump.</p><p>His actions followed a comment made by Trump about American Jews tagging American Jews who were democrats as disloyal to the Jewish people and Israel.</p><p>The statement offended the TV host, who sprang up in defence of the Jews during an episode of his show, “Anderson Cooper 360.” He slammed Trump for his comments, which he described as anti-Semitic, <a href=#>saying</a>:</p><p><strong>“It should be noted that throughout history, calling Jews disloyal has been a common anti-semitic trope. It’s been a pretext to exclude Jews or take their business or put them in ghettos or expel them from schools, or exterminate them.”</strong></p><p>His defence quickly earned him the support of the American Jewish population. The TV personality also called out Trump’s daughter, Ivanka Trump, who is Jewish, challenging her to not downplay another one of her dad’s offensive comments.</p><p>While his defence of the American Jewish Democrats was commendable, many wondered what spurred his sensitive reaction. Is Anderson Cooper Jewish? What is his nationality? What connections does he have to Israel? How did he become so famous? Here we address his nationality and all the most pressing <a href=#>questions</a> about him.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Is_Anderson_Cooper_Jewish></span><strong>Is Anderson Cooper Jewish?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>No, Anderson Cooper is not Jewish and has no known Jewish ancestry. However, he was raised in a catholic home by his mom Gloria Vanderbilt, the infamous fashion designer.</p><p>His upbringing instilled in him some morals and beliefs that may be somewhat similar. Yet, Cooper is not keen on following through with his childhood religion.</p><p>Rather, he strives to dissociate himself from religious, racial or political factions and treat all works of life as equals, thanks to his role as a journalist.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_Is_Anderson_Cooper></span><strong>Who Is Anderson Cooper?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>Anderson Cooper is a Broadcast journalist and political commentator, who serves as the primary anchor of CNN. He also works as a correspondent for “60 Minutes,” on CBS News.</p><p>He was born into the infamous Vanderbilt family, in Manhattan, New York. He graduated with a Bachelor of Arts Degree from Yale University in 1989.</p><p>His early journalism practice saw him travel the world, covering war-torn regions for Channel One News. By 1995, he landed a gig as a correspondent with ABC News.</p><p>In 2012, the news anchor came out as gay, making him the most prominent openly gay journalist on American television. He also became the first openly LGBT person to moderate a presidential debate.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_Is_Anderson_Cooper_Dating></span><strong>Who Is Anderson Cooper Dating?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>After coming out as gay, Anderson Cooper Went public with his relationship with Benjamin Maisani. They geared off their romance in 2009 and dated for years before their eventual split.</p><p>At the time, it was revealed that the former power couple split because they had different views on having kids. While Anderson Cooper dreamed of having a baby someday, Maisani had no intentions of becoming a father.</p><p>Surprisingly, soon after their split, they coupled up to adopt a <a href=#>son</a>, and have since remained adorable dads to their toddler, despite being exes.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Anderson-Cooper-Shares-New-Family-Photo-for-Son-Wyatts-2nd-Birthday-1-1024x510.jpeg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=How_Old_Is_Anderson_Cooper></span><strong>How Old Is Anderson Cooper?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Anderson Cooper landed the planet on June 3 1967, making him 55-year-old as of October 2022. Born to the Vanderbilt family, his mom was the famous heiress and fashion designer, Gloria Vanderbilt, while his dad was actor and screenwriter Wyatt Emory Cooper.</p><p>He also had an elder brother, who committed suicide at 21-year-old. His brother’s birth prompted him to pursue a career in journalism.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=What_Is_Anderson_Coopers_Real_Hair_Color></span><strong>What Is Anderson Cooper’s Real Hair Color?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>At fifty-five, Anderson Cooper is known for his signature white hair, which he has sported throughout his three-decades-long career.</p><p>Interestingly the white locks occur naturally, with no chemical or artificial additions. The icon originally had brown locks.</p><p>However, a patch of grey appeared on his hair as early as twenty years old and gradually spread throughout his hair. By thirty, he had a full-on natural “salt and pepper” hue. But as he grew older, every trace of brown disappeared, leaving the icon with his iconic white hair color.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=What_Is_The_Net_Worth_Of_Anderson_Cooper_Now></span><strong>What Is The Net Worth Of Anderson Cooper Now?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>CNN’s Anderson Cooper is worth over $200 million as of October 2022. Notably, he earned his fortune through his career as a journalist, political commentator and news anchor.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>He also did some modelling as a child. As the sole heir to his mom’s multimillion-dollar fortune, he is entitled to an increase in his vast wealth. However, his mom has proclaimed that her son would not claim any of her inheritance.</p><p>So Anderson Cooper may not be Jewish, but he sure has several <a href=#>unique attributes</a> which set him apart from other entertainment giants.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifmajBp7HSrWWcp51ktrR5wKebnqqjpLtur86op56qXZ%2ByuLXSoWSsoahivrax0q2gqKajYrCvuoyhpqysXZa7tMPEq5ydZw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./meaning-of-challenger-iron-on-me-by-juice-wrld.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Meaning of Challenger (Iron On Me) by Juice WRLD</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./hillary-clinton-72-looks-incredibly-youthful-event-broadway-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Hillary Clinton, 72, looks incredibly youthful at an event on Broadway</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./409878-100-summer-instagram-captions-sunny-funny-html.html>100+ summer Instagram captions that are sunny and funny</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-neck-cream.html>19 Best Neck Creams of 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./angelina-jolie-daughter-vivienne-resembles-brad-pitt-new-photo.html>Angelina Jolie's daughter Vivienne looks just like Brad Pitt in new photo from momentous outing toge</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chicagos-summer-smash-festival-signs-a-ticketing-deal-with-dice.html>Chicagos Summer Smash Festival Signs A Ticketing Deal With DICE</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./fosters-voice-reaching-his-peers-with-organization-of-school-club.html>Foster's Voice reaching his peers with organization of school club</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog.
