"But I know all the girls in the league are licking their chops to get their hands on her too. They build you up sometimes to tear you down."</p><h2 class=ue-c-article__subheadline>Who is Reggie Miller?</h2><p>Miller is regarded as one of the greatest shooters in NBA history and he is in the NBA Hall of Fame and he spent his entire 18-year career (1987-2005) with the <strong>Indiana Pacers</strong>, primarily as a shooting guard.</p><p><strong>Miller</strong>'s distinctive playing style was marked by his exceptional three-point shooting, clutch performances, and fierce competitiveness, so it is serious praise.</p><p><strong>Miller </strong>also ranks as the <strong>Pacers</strong>' all-time leading scorer, with over 25,000 points scored during his career.
