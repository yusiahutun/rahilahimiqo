The self-proclaimed loner has not concealed the fact that Michelle Rodriguez has itchy feet during romantic relationships. But over the years, the beautiful and spirited actress has had some interesting relationships with both men and women.</p><p>Michelle is an American actress. She has been recognized for her work in the film industry, including the Gotham Award for the best debut performance in her first role in Girl-fight. She is probably best known for her role as Letty in The Fast and the Furious Franchise, a role she has repeated five more times since. Michelle is a beautiful Latina woman and has attracted the attention of movie lovers around the world. Meanwhile, her relationships have taken her through the course of events, and we will investigate that.</p><p>Born on July 12, 1978, in San Antonio, Texas, USA Michelle is Latino through and through with her mother, Carmen Milady Rodriguez is Dominican and her father, Rafael Rodriguez is Puerto Rican.</p><p>During her growth, Michelle Rodriguez moved around a lot between the ages of eight and eleven, lived in the Dominican Republic, and also spent some time in her father’s home country, Puerto Rico, when she was 17. Michelle comes from a large family of ten siblings and half-siblings. When she grew up, she was a somewhat naughty girl, as she was expelled from five schools. Her ancestry has connections to three continents, including Africa, Europe, and America.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Matt Schaub Wife, Family, Height, Weight, Body Stats, Net Worth</a></strong></p><p>Acting for Michelle began with the movie “Girlfight”. She had seen an ad and at auditions, she had deprived a lot of other people of the available role. She played the role of a teenager who channeled her aggression through boxing training. The film won awards and Rodriguez also received a number of awards and nominations.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Who Is Michelle Rodriguez Dating?</strong></h2><p>For the past ten years, Michelle has had a romantic relationship with some of Hollywood’s best bachelors. After her brief time with the fast and furious star Vin Diesel, Michelle seems to have taken a break from the relationship. We take a look at the list of Michelle’s exes.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Her Ex-Boyfriends and Girlfriends</strong></h2><p>Rodriguez is outspoken and one who will do what he thinks is right. In 2013 she was quoted as saying: “I went both ways. She also revealed that she finds men “fascinating” as well. The following year she described herself as bisexual.</p><p>In early 2000, Rodriguez broke off an engagement with an unnamed Muslim friend, citing religious differences. From this point on, the profile of the men/women with whom Lady Rodriguez met can be considered a roll call of those who are important in the American entertainment industry: from Zach Efron to Vin Diesel and Lenny Kravitz, Michelle has had an adventurous love life.</p><h4 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Zac Efron</strong></h4><p>Rodriguez and Efron began their collaboration in June 2014, and despite the age difference they seemed to manage to separate for about two months in August 2014. In June of the same year, they were spotted together on vacation, and the rumor mill blew up.</p><h4 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Cara Delevingne</strong></h4><p>Her mating with model Cara Delevigne was noticed during a basketball game on the edge of the court. The spotlight intensified when they kissed together. However, the relationship was short-lived.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Simon Mignolet Wife, Weight, Height, Body Measurements, Bio</a></strong></p><h4 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Kristanna Loken</strong></h4><p>In November 2006 there was a rumor that Rodriguez and her co-star at Bloodrayne Kristanna Loken were dating. Some of Loken’s comments in an interview with The Advocate seem to confirm the idea that the couple was together. They were photographed on several occasions with their hands around each other.</p><h4 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Lenny Kravitz</strong></h4><p>Lenny is an actor and musician famous for the retro feeling of his soulful songs. Rodriguez went out with Lenny in 2005. Michelle also appeared in a music video with Lenny Kravitz. Although they were sighted separately, none of them made any effort to back up the story.</p><h4 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Oliver Martinez</strong></h4><p>The couple was caught kissing and was found on P. Diddy’s yacht in Southern France. But they claimed that they were only good friends.</p><h4 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Vin Diesel</strong></h4><p>Diesel and Michelle Rodriguez shared a relationship on the set of The Fast and Furious that seemed to take on a real form. The off-screen romance couldn’t last as long as the one on-screen, but they have maintained a friendship over the years.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo7XLsmWcp51kxKm7jKKqZqWZmLWmuMueZKunlKe2qMHEs2SdmaSeu6h5wGajoqukYryneceeqWadqGKvsMXFq6CeppSoeqK6w2aeoqqcm7%2Bqsc2dqmg%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./19-facts-about-drednaw.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>19 Facts About Drednaw - Facts.net</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./georgina-lightning.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Georgina Lightning dating?
