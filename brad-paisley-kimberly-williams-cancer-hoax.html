"So it sounded very sort of real," she explains. "But she wasn't dying to get a hold of me. You know, that was kind of the beginning of the manipulation."</p><p>For 10 days, the pair spoke via emails, texts and through phone calls. Photographs of the little girl, allegedly named Claire, were sent along with journal entries and songs the girl had sung for Kimberly. At one point, Brad even got on the phone to sing 'Amazing Grace' for the sick child.</p><p>"You're singing to someone's dying kid," the CMA Awards co-host shares. "And in the middle of it, there's no way that's not real. How can that not be real?"</p><p>But then, red flags started to appear when Claire supposedly passed away. The Paisleys wanted to send flowers, but the little girl's mom wouldn't give out an address.</p><p>The red flags Kimberly saw were spot-on -- as it turns out, the photos were taken from the blog of a girl who actually has neuroblastoma. "That's the sickest part about this to me," Brad admits. "That is the part that when I start to talk about that, that's when I get really mad. That there were real kids, that there were real photos involved."</p><p>The Paisleys weren't the first to be "catfished" by elaborate hoaxes quite similar to this one. 'Nightline' investigated and found&nbsp;<a href=#>Little Big Town</a>, Kate Gosselin, members of the Dallas Cowboy Cheerleaders and singers Mandisa, Natalie Grant, Francesca Battistelli and Carmen Hope Thomas were also scammed.</p><p>"I vowed then I was going to find her,” Brad insists of the scammer. “I’m going to find her, and I’m going to make sure this person isn’t able to do this, or isn’t capable of doing worse."</p><p>The 'Nightline' special airs Wednesday at 12:35AM ET, following the 2013 CMA Awards.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskajBprvFnKaupqSnxm%2BvzqZmm6qRmXqxrciso56xXaC2rq7Eq6OyZaeeua21wKaqZpuRo7CmvoyhppqwXw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./drake-and-21-savage-announce-the-its-all-a-blur-tour-for-2023.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Drake and 21 Savage Announce The Its All a Blur Tour For 2023</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./long-distance-friendship-quotes-1230625.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>111 Long Distance Friendship Quotes to Cherish Unbreakable Bonds</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./409878-100-summer-instagram-captions-sunny-funny-html.html>100+ summer Instagram captions that are sunny and funny</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-neck-cream.html>19 Best Neck Creams of 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./angelina-jolie-daughter-vivienne-resembles-brad-pitt-new-photo.html>Angelina Jolie's daughter Vivienne looks just like Brad Pitt in new photo from momentous outing toge</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chicagos-summer-smash-festival-signs-a-ticketing-deal-with-dice.html>Chicagos Summer Smash Festival Signs A Ticketing Deal With DICE</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./fosters-voice-reaching-his-peers-with-organization-of-school-club.html>Foster's Voice reaching his peers with organization of school club</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog.
