They ordered six dishes, including the urchin one, and were charged 2,655 yuan.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Zhang said after carefully checking inside the urchin shells, he was unable to find any urchin meat.

However, Zhang remained unconvinced and has been defiant in online posts. In response, the restaurant owner has threatened to sue Zhang for damaging his reputation.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The local authorities said the preparation process was transparent, based on the surveillance footage it reviewed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2021/04/13/6265d41f-b018-4a85-b5fc-88ce0e43ed53_f60200c9.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Zhang said he felt speechless after the investigation was concluded. “This is the result that the whole country’s internet users and us have been waiting for?” he said on social media.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">At a press conference on Monday, Feng Fei, Hainan’s governor, said the government would launch a “deeper investigation to respond to the public’s concern in a timely manner”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Hainan provincial authorities have paid high attention to the tourism market order,” said Feng. “In the past few years, Hainan has been overhauling with high efforts the three aspects: supervision system, complaint channel and specific problems [of the tourism sector].”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">During the investigation the restaurant said customers may not have found urchin meat in the dish easily because urchins do not grow much out of season.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The owner, whose name was not released, told China National Radio he was 95 per cent sure he would sue Zhang over his public comments which the owner said could ruin the restaurant’s reputation.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“The remaining five per cent depends on this customer’s attitude and sincerity of making an apology to us,” the owner was quoted as saying.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Zhang defended himself, saying he exposed the scandal because it was his legal right.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“We travelled to Sanya aiming to have make a happy memory. Making trouble is not my intention,” he told news portal Red Star News. “I spent so much money on eating in this restaurant but was still swindled.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In the past Sanya has had a reputation for cheating tourists. In 2012, domestic media reported that a tourist was charged 4,000 yuan for just “three ordinary dishes” at a restaurant which prompted many online to complain of similar experiences.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Cases of tourists being cheated while holidaying in China remain common. A 2017 CCTV investigative report found that a tour agency in Guilin, Guangxi province, took tourists to fewer scenic spots than what were listed in itinerary and pushed them to spend more time shopping.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In 2015, a tourist to Qingdao, Shandong, ordered a shrimp dish priced at 38 yuan. However, on the bill, the restaurant charged him that amount for each individual shrimp in the dish.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51ku6bD0minnqegobJur9Slq66qlWTBs7HNnaCnn12Ytaq6wGiYq6yZmLmme5JqaXJrZ2l8pLTIp5ysnV2cvLex0aemq2WYlravrc1mp66knJqxbr%2FAp7CaZaOarqe7zp0%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./jay-leno-talks-retirement-following-terrifying-car-crash-and-motorcycle-accident.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Jay Leno talks surprising retirement plans as he continues to recover from terrifying car fire and m</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./abbey-clancy-sky-high-legs-tiny-denim-shorts.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Abbey Clancy puts sky-high legs on full display in tiny denim shorts and daring boots</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./409878-100-summer-instagram-captions-sunny-funny-html.html>100+ summer Instagram captions that are sunny and funny</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-neck-cream.html>19 Best Neck Creams of 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./angelina-jolie-daughter-vivienne-resembles-brad-pitt-new-photo.html>Angelina Jolie's daughter Vivienne looks just like Brad Pitt in new photo from momentous outing toge</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chicagos-summer-smash-festival-signs-a-ticketing-deal-with-dice.html>Chicagos Summer Smash Festival Signs A Ticketing Deal With DICE</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./fosters-voice-reaching-his-peers-with-organization-of-school-club.html>Foster's Voice reaching his peers with organization of school club</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 WinkBlog.
