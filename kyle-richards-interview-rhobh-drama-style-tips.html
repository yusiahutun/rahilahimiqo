"Milestones with my children that I get to get documented. Whether it's sad - dropping them off at college; I'm always going to have that. And Farrah graduating, Bar Mitzvahs, learning to drive a car, all those things. I just think, life gets so crazy and hectic and now we have an iPhone, you never take proper photos, we don't run around with video cameras like we used to. I have some great professional family home videos."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/ee5cbac94e04-kyle-richards-pink-blazer-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=ewQvYaXwuAH0 data-wc=6><strong>Kyle loves classic yet edgy looks</strong></p><p id=eGn1XsiHno81 data-wc=83>Speaking about her hardest times on the series, the brunette beauty explained: "It's when I'm arguing with somebody. I know that's a given, but obviously the hardest was with my sister Kim, as that's family. When we have these arguments on the show, it doesn't just end when the cameras go off, and it spills into your personal life, and you can't help the mood and how you are feeling. I try very hard not to let it affect my mood at home."</p><p id=eg178LHE7Nuh data-wc=1><strong>READ:&nbsp;<a class=hm-link href=#>Bethenny Frankel just twinned with Kate Middleton and nobody noticed</a></strong></p><p id=epDd9FM1AZOy data-wc=125>And how has life changed? "My life has evolved in so many ways. When I started the show, I hadn't been acting for a while and I had a new baby. So at that moment, I was a busy stay-at-home mum. I was exhausted from kids stuff like homework, doctors and dentists, soccer practice and tennis lessons, all that stuff, and all of a sudden, I was a working mum and had all that guilt. But then, I became really proud to be a working mum and producing television and back acting again, and the more I'm doing, the more my daughters are proud of me. So it's evolved a lot in that sense. And watching ourselves and reflecting on everything, you learn and grow.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/aeb95558ff00-kyle-richards-and-husband-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=ey1I4XWGX2RT data-wc=6><strong>Kyle with her husband&nbsp;Mauricio Umansky</strong></p><p id=epUzJ5JmggoZ data-wc=66>Kyle has impeccable, glam style. But she surprisingly revealed she has never had a stylist! "I'm sure people are like, 'Yeah you can tell!' but no, never had one. I don't travel with a glam squad either.

The best-dressed royal in her opinion has to be the late Diana, Princess of Wales. "I mean, I have to go with Diana. Of course I think that Kate Middleton dresses beautifully, but I just feel Diana had so many iconic moments. For me as a little girl, I lived in London for a while when I was doing a movie, and I think she and Charles were dating at the time and I can remember so many of her outfits! The 'revenge dress' and then her cycling shorts with the socks, and her dress that blew up at the sports day, I just loved her."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/8d65369e3f83-princess-diana-cycling-police-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=eyim5_L1F7mX data-wc=6><strong>Princess Diana is Kyle's best-dressed royal</strong></p><p id=eDy5ROTvgxTR data-wc=71>And when it comes to her favourite beauty product, Kyle is so down to earth.

I never use waterproof mascara as you can't get it off, and it's bad for your lashes. That's the best one, as it's buildable. What I've learned is, the cheaper mascaraas are the best ones.
